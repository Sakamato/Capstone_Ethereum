It would be easy for pretty much any blockchain to match Ethereum's tx throughput. Having larger-faster blocks isn't complicated and can be replicated on any blockchain. The problem with faster-larger blocks is that it will only get you so far, the blockchain can only get so big before it is impractical. Over the next few years crytpos will need to scale transaction throughput by at least 1000x. That is certainly too much data for a decentralized main chain. This is why bitcoin core has been resisting using block size increases as a primary scaling method. Side chain and overlay networks have a lot more promise for scaling. RSK's Lumino update claims to support 2000 transactions per second. I can see bitcoin maybe doing 10x scaling on chain, but everything else is going to be on side chains or on higher layers.

I'm regularly helping people brute force their passwords to their keystores, scanning old hard drives for keystore files, brute forcing seed phrases that were written down wrong, and helping with all other manner of fuckups.  

People are under the *illusion* of security when left to their own devices, and the only thing actually protecting them is that they really aren't a worthwhile target for somebody to put effort into hacking.  This is why I harp on the fact that privacy is a much more important security measure than having an actually secure network-system.  Nobody is going to target you if you aren't broadcasting that you're a big fish.  

> But muh harwar waller

Means nothing if you're seed phrase isn't secured.  Does nothing if you aren't diligent about verifying the receiving address on all transactions.  *Potentially* doesn't even protect you if somebody has physical access to the device.  

Again, the hardware wallet isn't an impenetrable fortress of security, but the probability of somebody even trying are next to nothing to begin with unless you're flaunting sensitive information around.

* ÂµRaiden is a many-to-one unidirectional state channel protocol, while the Raiden Network is a many-to-many bidirectional solution and implies a more complex design of channel networks. This allows the Raiden Network to efficiently send transfers without being forced to pay for opening new channels with people who are already in the network.

* ÂµRaiden off-chain transactions do not cost anything, as they are only exchanged between sender and receiver. The Raiden Network has a more complicated incentive-based off-chain transport of transaction information, from one user to another (following the channel network path used to connect the sender and the receiver).

- Create a virtual machine with linux and 200GB or so of disk space. If possible, use a machine that doesn't have lots of users and is less likely to be compromised.
- Download your wallet software for your cryptocurrencies (Parity for Ethereum, Electrum for BTC, etc). Make sure that the software is open source and a recommended software by the community.
- Create a wallets, place the private keys and seeds on an encrypted volume (you can use veracrypt) and make several backup copies of that volume.
- Print and-or save copies of the public addresses so that you can give them away when necessary.
- Delete the VM, create another one and check you can restore the wallets.
- Once you know you can restore your wallets, transfer your currency there.
- If you are just hodling, destroy the VM, as you don't have any need for it, just for the keys.
- If you will be using those currencies, you can keep the VM, but make sure that the -home is encrypted.

That's how I personally have it. I don't keep a VM, just the seeds encrypted using veracrypt on several locations.

1,dq44xlq,"I was reading some of VB's technical posts relating to POS and learned that 1000 is not really a hard minimum: [VB's post on slashing](https:--medium.com-@VitalikButerin-minimal-slashing-conditions-20f0b500fc6c), [tech. article on POS] (https:--www.ethnews.com-proof-of-stake-vitalik-buterin-shares-casper-contract-code)

Please feel free to call me out if I'm mistaken:

So, since POS is being implemented via a contract, it looks like validators will be making two routine contract calls every block: ""prepare"" and ""commit"". VB says that at some point in the future they might make an exception to the transaction cost to run these contract commands- but until then they will have a normal cost. So without showing his math, VB is saying it won't be initially profitable for someone to validate unless they have 1000-4000 ETH. So, someone with 500 ETH isn't prevented from validating transactions- they will simply be making less money then they are spending to interact with the contract.

The fees are basically flat rate; this is why it becomes profitable if you took your 10 or 100 or 500 ETH and joined a pool that would share these contract fees. Even if you had 1000-4000 ETH, you might still be better off joining a pool where the transaction fees are split amongst the pool. Even if the pool is taking a cut- the cut might be less than if you were paying the full fees yourself.

First of all Ethereum is GPU mineable and does not use ASICs as the article suggests.

Its like banning the post office from offering express shipping to metro areas at a cheaper rate than to the country. I guarantee you that the ISP is better placed where it relates to their own platform, their peering agreements and what they do or do not upgrade to make decisions than the government. Remember the inciting incident was a company refusing to upgrade their equipment facing their peer to carry more netflix.

2. If you don't like your ISP ensure that the government isn't propping them up somehow. Ensure that your property doesn't have some kind of exclusivity arrangement with them. Drum up support in your neighbourhood for change.

3. Check out -r-wisp. Lots of small companies delivering quality services over class license spectrum. Support these guys over some knucklehead with a HFC monopoly.

4. Regarding the cable TV - EA packaging strawman. Don't forget that this model would have a significant benefit for a group of consumers that only use those services.

Already, I see how it can improve e-Waste tracking, food security, and artist's payments.  We need more developers!
 
My plan is Mid Jan, and I've been trying to figure out:

1. What's better -- a weekend course -- say 2 days, 4 hours each, a single day of 8 hours ( weekend?  Weekday? ), or 4 weeknights? -- in other words -- what's the best time for people's schedules?

2. Pricing -- I don't yet have a pricing model.  I'm thinking around $200, with a full scholarship for women and a $100 student discount.  The alternative is a flat $150 with no scholarships-discounts.  What's better?

3. Starting point knowledge.  Should I presume everyone already knows node-javascript-linux?  Should I make a pre-course for that, and push this course out a couple of weeks?

4. How to get the word out on a routine basis.  I think the number of people I'd get via meetup might fill a class once -- but I want to do this a few times.  What's the best way to advertise this?  Radio ads?  Facebook?  Twitter?  Specific websites?  How would I reach enough people to fill the class every month?

5. Is there any one question you really want the course to cover?  For example, I feel that solc is more important to know than Truffle, and VSCode a better IDE than remix -- but others may feel differently.  What's your rank order of importance?

Target is to do this routinely -- say every month or so -- so I'm looking for the format that serves the most people.  Totally open to input on how to make this as wide-inclusive as possible in the Seattle metro area.

25,dqglwhf,"There's a discrepancy in this image.

Bitcoin says 0.3-2 hours with fees $0.3-16. Which isn't quite correct. Yes, now it's quite and you can send a transaction for $4. But just a week or two ago it was $25 and they didn't pass through in 2 hours (my friend waited for a week!). And if you use $0.3 as a fee - you'll pray that it ever passes through.

So I'd say $2-20 and 0.3-12 hours for bitcoin.

And for Ethereum it's the contrary - $0.1 fee is a long timer. Now you can safely send money for $0.001 and it will still be processed in a couple of minutes. You can even go lower if you risk it (if you write Bitcoins $0.3 then you should probably mention $0.0001 in ETH too).

Same for the time - even with such a low fee - it's minutes. May be 30 minutes if it's some gas-eating contract. But if you use something higher, like $0.1 - it'll be there in the next block probably - which is just 15 seconds. And $1 dollar? That's a gas price of 100 gwei! Or some contract - but we're not speaking about contracts here, but regular transfers, right? Bitcoin or visa don't have smart-contracts you can compare it to.

So for ETH I would write: 15sec-30min, $0.0001-$0.2

And that would be fair and kinda comparable to what Raiden & Visa.

This is then broadcast to these lite nodes who find they cannot validate it because they do not have state information for blocks older than 1024 blocks. The lite nodes then have to rebuild the entire state from genesis in order to validate or invalidate the new chain. If all nodes in the network are lite nodes then they will all be effectively out of service for the duration of this rebuild. The only solution to this is for nodes to maintain full state data, which corresponds to the geth 'full' mode. This has a space penalty currently around 400gb and projected to rise to 1TB in 2018.

One of them is the new ABI decoder, which is still in experimental mode, but will hopefully be production-usable soon. External contributions like allowing constant variables for array lengths and improved error messages should make your life as a programmer easier. Finally, the standard-json-io-system now allows to select certain artifacts from a contract which should speed up your code-compile-test-cycle even more!

**Features:**

 * Code Generator: New ABI decoder which supports structs and arbitrarily nested
   arrays and checks input size (activate using ``pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;``).
 * General: Allow constant variables to be used as array length.
 * Inline Assembly: ``if`` statement.
 * Standard JSON: Support the ``outputSelection`` field for selective compilation of target artifacts.
 * Syntax Checker: Turn the usage of ``callcode`` into an error as experimental 0.5.0 feature.
 * Type Checker: Improve address checksum warning.
 * Type Checker: More detailed errors for invalid array lengths (such as division by zero).

No disrespect, but I'm starting to feel a bit alarmed by how many of my friends have no idea what currency actually *is*, and they are a part of the machine. Things I've heard from Forex guys recently:

- you don't actually think crypto will supplant the USD do you? 
- but crypto doesn't have *real* value, you know?
- the US isn't going to just let this get out of hand. 

The last point is perhaps most concerning: these are lazy, content people who have gone their entire lives leeching off the system, assuming their government will always be there to provide for them, not realizing that their government gives little to no fucks about them in actuality and that the world is changing.

INVENTOR, ETHEREUM

Standing in front of about 2,000 developers and computer programmers at the Ethereum Foundation Developers Conference in Cancun, Mexico, in early November, Buterin, 23, talked about the future of the network. Recent upgrades will take ethereum from the state where it is now into something that will be used by millions of people, he said, wearing gray shorts and a green T-shirt with a picture of internet meme dog Doge. Is he right? Maybe. Last year hackers stole $55 million of ether, and soon after Buterins speech, $171 million of it and an unknown amount of other cryptocurencies were lost when the funds were accidentally frozen.

Yet the potential for ethereum to upend how computers move money continues to attract Wall Streets attention. Already its altering how companies fund development: Ether is a popular vehicle for buying into initial coin offerings, or ICOs, which bypass the traditional routes of venture capital and initial public offerings (and, to date, securities regulation). Its helped blockchain startups raise more than $3 billion this year.

At the conference, Buterin explained that the network went through a security upgrade in October. Hes working on a plan to cut costs for verifying transactionsbecause ofbecause of how many computers connect to form the blockchain, estimates put electricity costs at about $1 million a day¨¹and another one to slash transaction times. A year ago, Buterin said, it was hard to see all of this coming to fruition. But, he added, ¨¹a lot of things have solidified.¨¹

I find this to be an extremely admirable level of maturity and self-control, above which I posses myself. 

We should all remember this when people start talking about the failures-successes of Ethereum.  Cryptokitties isn't Ethereum's problem, it's the community's (assuming you see it as a problem at all, which I don't). Scalability *is* Ethereum's problem, and it's actively being worked on. Either you're involved with and aware of these developments and you believe in the future they can create, or you don't.  This is purely a matter of belief in the community, developers, and direction, and there is not 'correct' opinion to have.

Obviously they will lose value at first, since the images and DNA code will be lost in the new 'kitties', in a similar way a crypto fork, when the alternative ledger loses network, mining, etc.

Instead, I believe the tweet is referring to this paragraph: 


> 
> A key question for all ICO market participants: ¨¹Is the coin or token a security?¨¹  As securities law practitioners know well, the answer depends on the facts.  For example, a token that represents a participation interest in a book-of-the-month club may not implicate our securities laws, and may well be an efficient way for the club¨¹s operators to fund the future acquisition of books and facilitate the distribution of those books to token holders.  In contrast, many token offerings appear to have gone beyond this construct and are more analogous to interests in a yet-to-be-built publishing house with the authors, books and distribution networks all to come.

3,dr5hcfl,"Basic Attention Token (BAT), the Ethereum-based project by Brendan Eich (the inventor of *JavaScript* and founder of *Mozilla* and *Firefox*) is actually meant to fundamentally rethink how digital ads are delivered. If you've already heard of BAT, that's actually Brendan's larger vision here to improve the web as a whole. In short, the idea is that you can achieve ad-matching **without ever having to expose users' personal data**. Hopefully in the future, then, any excuse or request to track your personal information will be obsolete. 

Anyway, you do this by delivering ads from *within* the native app (like a web browser). As a result, the browser can just match local user data to a local catalog and match that way. All signals in; none out. You don't ever have to expose your data to third parties as a result. 

Brendan said he started thinking about this after he saw his own baby, JavaScript, being used for all these questionable advertising purposes, prompting him to think about the digital advertising paradigm as a whole.

Because it's already a medium of exchange made to pay for a utility, the use of the EVM and any application working on it.

And it's also a unit of account, for it's used to account for global computation use & it may be used by any application as their main accounting unit - as it happens with token for example or kitties.

So: with ether you can now pay directly for services (use of EVM computation & decentralised applications), tokens and even crypto-collectibles (miaaow); ether is the unit of account for Ethereum and any application working on it; and soon it'll be a great store of value with guaranteed rentability.",2017-12-13 06:28:00

13,dr5u4tq,"Bitcoin is nothing for the banking system. It's useless compared to fiat because too volatile and too deflationary for credits.  
Name things by what they are: Bitcoin is a highly speculative asset without an intrinistic value which could compete with gold (not the banking system) which currently holds the same function in our society. The only thing which is special about Bitcoin is it's insanely high media exposure which made it some sort of a brand or a weirdass cult; nowadays any name with 'Bitcoin' in it is a literal money magnet (Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Diamond).  
  
Ethereum is an interesting platform with potential to turn into some kind of future 'world currency'. Next to the 'Petrodollar' as an exchange medium backed by the promise that one can buy energy for it on the market and that people also need it to pay taxes in the strongest economy of the world we might soon see a 'Computationdollar', which would be Ethereum; an exchange medium that holds the promise that one can pay for ACCURATE computations on the internet with it. Where you'd need a controller-notary to confirm that every computation (f.e. iteration of a program or a transfer of value) the network spits out is correct you put Ethereum; because it's highly unlikely that the consensus of the network would build on a lie, as it would require a vast majority of the network to believe in this lie and unlike in conspiracy theories worldwide agreements which lie far from the truth simply don't happen in the real world so one can assume with an incredibly high probability, that a program in a smart contract will be executed exactly as stated in the program.  
Technically Ethereum lets you perform operations on data (run programs) without the necessity of your computer to interact with said data directly, because the data packets only interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. You also don't need to trust a 3rd party server host as a middle man who sets the rules for data flow between two users of a network.  
Having the programs (also called smart contracts) run on the EVM instead of the user's computer cuts away the risk of the user's computer being exposed to data packets which could contain malware or other harmful code. Consequently Ethereum enables many interesting usecases (f.e. mesh networks or decentralized computing clouds and others) which weren't possible on the internet and could be the foundation for many new applications.  
  
tl;dr4bitcoin Technically there is no difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin except for the fact that Ethereum can do everything Bitcoin can cheaper (lower tx cost) and faster (better scalability) and also many more things, so please stop speading the lie as if Bitcoin had any 'special utility' which makes it suitable to replace banks as mediators in financial transactions, because literally every cryptocurrency can do what Bitcoin does and some of them can do way more.  
  
tl;dr4ethereum  
Internet: User<->Server<->User  
Interaction on the internet happens via a middle-man who sets the rules of the data flow. This middle-man (server host) interacts directly with the users and exposes himself to faulty code which might be transferred in data packets by one of the users. The server host is generally less likely than the average to fall victim to a cyberattack due to his above-average degree of IT-expertise so he takes the risk on him and gets paid for this function as a middle man (on top of the electricity- and hardware costs)  
Ethereum: User<->EVM<->User  
Interaction on the Ethereum network doesn't require a middle-man or rather the function of the middle-man becomes taken over by the EVM. The smart contract on the Ethereum networks sets the rules of the data flow and does so without the additional cost for the user (well, there is the gas-cost, but it will become much lower once Ethereum is able to scale-shard properly and the network becomes mainstream). Ethereum adds another layer of security to web-interaction because unlike a server, a smart contract 'cannot' be hacked as one'd have to hack the majority of the nodes for that and not even NSA could pull it off.",2017-12-13 07:51:00

1. When a dApp is programmed and then deployed onto the blockchain, is that code then untouchable? What if the creator wanted to make updates to their application? (Decentralization issue?) meaning is it truly decentralized if the creator of a dApp can continue to make changes and modifications?

2. Would like for you to add some info on scaling issues.

5,dr6y1j9,"Thank you for the write-up, it was useful. I do have one minor, but important point to make about this:

> The smart contract is simple: IF flight is over two hours late, THEN pay policyholder. The smart contract is connected to a database that monitors flight times. If the database shows that the flight is over two hours late,  the smart contract is triggered and the policyholder is paid automatically over the blockchain. 

>Without the smart contract, the policyholder would have to file a claim and wait for the insurance company's claims department to process it, which could take anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks. With the smart contract, neither the insurance company nor the policyholder has to do anything. This also creates trust between the two parties because there are no grey areas - the customer can review the smart contract prior to purchasing the policy and feel comfortable that he will receive his claim in the event of a delay. 

This is not trustless in the same sense that transfer of coins is trustless because the database that the contract relies on is external and therefore prone to tampering. If it is tampered with, the transaction is irreversible and so would still have to be settled outside of the blockchain. It also seems like it should still be more efficient anyhow, but it certainly is open to abuse (as is the status quo of course). So the level of trust one should have is still at the same level as trust one should have in an external database (which people may be motivated to tamper with).",2017-12-14 00:07:00

1: What is the price in Ether tokens to run-access a dApp? Is it a ratio, 1 token, etc.

2: I get why the Ethereum Foundation hard forked in the case of DAO, but is this not a problem that is likely to reoccur? 

It's a pretty precarious situation for Ethereum. Holders will lose trust in Ether if crappy apps are built and they lose money, but they will also lose trust if the team has to keep hard forking to prevent these types of issues. Is would seem like checks and balances might need to be put in place, but that only centralizes the development-oversight of thesedApps. 

3: Are there other widely used dApps you can recommend? I'd like to do some research to learn more about the practical applications that exist. Something for creating simple smart contracts that anyone can develop would be great to see.

4: I get the benefit of keeping transactions and smart contracts on a blockchain, but are there checks in place to confirm the legitimacy of the information triggering a transaction?

I'll go with the flight departure example. What if the system for recording flight delays is inaccurate, or human error causes a mistake. Would using smart contracts not lose value if the inputs are not 100% trusted?

Thanks if you can help!

To be clear, I'm not at all trying to be negative about Ethereum and realize it's a developing project.

I have a question about the smart contract portion. I understand Bitcoin fairly well, and how the Ethereum blockchain is in many ways similar to it (today), but I've never been clear on how smart contracts actually get executed, even after reading the whitepaper.

I know a bit a bout gas and its relation to ether and computational steps, but I still have more foundational questions that always seem to be glossed over in explanations like this.

* On which CPU's do smart contracts get validated?
* How is the owner of said CPU compensated for the work done by the CPU?
* How does a contract participant know that the code was executed honestly? How does the network verify the output?
* Is contract code executed many times, or only once?
* How does a long-standing contract (eg, transfer X ether from one address to another given some predicate) get executed? Can it sit on the blockchain for years and constantly check for this predicate?",2017-12-14 01:55:00

Contracts can't self-execute. Execution has to be triggered by a transaction, so grandma would still have to remember to do it, all the contract would do is stop her from sending the money on days other than Billy's birthday

> Running dApps on the blockchain also offers added security benefits. Since the transactions are distributed and encrypted across the Ethereum blockchain, there is no central place for a hacker to breach and gain access to all of the world's Grandmother to grandson birthday payment data. 

There is no encryption by default, and everything is just about as public as can possibly be.

Some things you might want to think about:

You say execute automatically - smart contracts cannot call themselves, there are ways around this (pay someone to call it for you, have a node running and call it yourself), but it's not a feature of Ethereum. Your example is fine provided Grandma has an Ethereum node running :)

The AXA thing is a neat example, and it's not wrong, but keep in mind there's no functional difference between what you've said and AXA paying the flight tracker to handle refunds for them with normal bank accounts - the smart contract is relying on the tracker to tell the truth.

5,dr7ko6q,"Okay, here's some more brutal feedback. This isn't an attack. It's to help you improve your writing. Hopefully it helps.

While you've gotten many technical details correct, you haven't really created an easy thread for someone new to follow. Let's take your introduction:

> By now, most people know Ethereum as the second most valuable cryptocurrency, currently valued at over $60 billion dollars. Well, it turns out that Ethereum isn't actually a cryptocurrency - it's a software platform that let's programmers build applications on top of blockchain technology

First off you're bogging down with jargon. If I were noob I'd be asking the following questions while reading this:

1. What exactly is a cryptocurrency then if Ethereum isn't one?

2. You're assuming I (like ""most people"") know about Ethereum and cryptocurrencies are already, so why am I reading this?

3. What does it mean for a cryptocurrency to be ""the second most valuable""? (Is a pound more valuable than a dollar? Does that matter? Is ""second most valuable"" something that matters?)

4. Why are you talking about cryptocurrencies if Ethereum isn't one?

5. What's a software platform do? (for me?)

6. What is blockchain technology? (and why do I care?)

7. Who are these programmers who are building applications on top of this thing I don't understand and why would I care in the slightest? (And note you haven't really answered Q1 because, to your audience, it's just more indecipherable jargon)

8. What's wrong with using a credit card instead of all this complex nonsense?

9. What's the problem you're trying to solve here?

It's fine to leave the reader with a question or two. That's going to help motivate them to keep reading. But this is too much confusion. The biggest issues are the first and last questions. Sure, technically, you can say Ether is the cryptocurrency and Ethereum is the platform, but splitting hairs isn't helping anyone's understanding when you're introducing the topic. So while technically correct in some contexts*, it doesn't help the reader understand anything. They're just left wondering where the cryptocurrency aspect fits in. (Which would be OK as a singular question to motivate further reading, but the reader is also given a bunch of other terminology to juggle in their head at the same time).

Second paragraph doesn't help:

> Bitcoin uses a global network of computers that maintain a shared ledger called a blockchain that keeps track of who owns bitcoin. Once blockchain technology was introduced to the world, people realized that blockchains could be used to keep track of anything of value. 

(note: you should have a paragraph break here)

You've just explained blockchain technology in two sentences. 

There's nothing wrong with the explanation itself. It can be understood by anyone who already understands blockchain technology or perhaps anyone technical in the financial world. But it's only half-answered one of the questions from above, and, while technically not-inaccurate, it doesn't give anything for a newbie to grasp onto. The reader has been given half an answer and it only increases their cognitive load: What's ""shared ledger"" mean? Who's it shared with? Who runs this global network of computers and why? Is ledger being used as a computing metaphor like ""block"" and ""chain"" or like in accounting? Why's it called a blockchain? Why would anyone trust it? Why are you telling me this? What problem is it solving? How does it explain why ethereum isn't a cryptocurrency, etc. It's like you've tried to write a 10-page Wikipedia article in two sentences.

My overall advice would be *not* to break everything down into smaller and smaller pieces which go deeper and deeper into jargon. (i.e. don't try to directly answer the questions I've listed) Instead, start with a problem statement and then show how blockchain technology and Ethereum in particular solve that problem. Introduce jargon as necessary, along the way.

e.g. Grandma doesn't trust banks, and wants to send her grandson a birthday gift every year. How can she do this? Then explain Ethereum by showing the reader how it solves this problem. Contriving a good example that can help the reader through the whole piece will be a challenge.

That's my main advice.

And finally, as for whether Ethereum is a cryptocurrency or a network. While Vitalik might be careful to separate his usage of the terms *Ethereum*  and *Ether*, many people in day-to-day conversation use *Ethereum* to mean the coin itself, and frankly it doesn't sound wrong, e.g. ""Ethereum not showing up in my coinbase wallet"", ""I'm going all in on ethereum"", or coinmarketcap.com's list of the top three cryptocurrencies: ""Bitcoin,  Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash"". Words get their meaning from their usage, not from language architects. Splitting hairs and telling the reader that Ethereum doesn't mean what they've already heard it to mean isn't really helping you explain Ethereum (in any sense of the word). You might as be arguing that *decimate* only means to remove a tenth of something. I'd suggest saying that ""Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency"" or something along those lines instead of making it an argument.

What if all the applications written into the Ethereum blockchain have to be proven to be correct via say Coq first? Of course, it's probably too restrictive to demand all programmers to know Coq just to be able to write applications for Ethereum, but what if the program used to proving and thus approving of the apps is build into the Ethereum system itself?

so you guys have all pointed out to me that Grandma's contract can't self execute. I thought having something execute based on date was a relatively simple command but apparently I was mistaken. 

I think what I failed to specify was that it has to be connected to an oracle DB, an arrangement could be made with a 3rd party.

I would like to keep the example because I think it concretely exemplifies that value can be programmed - I do not want it in there however, if it is factually incorrect. 

Do you think it can stay in there

* a) as is (that answer seems to be no). I like to keep things as simple as possible and want to avoid complicating things if not necessary 
* b) if I specify that it would require a 3rd party DB like with the AXA example 
*  c) hell no it's got to go. Would like to avoid this one since the Grandma example is cited several times throughout the piece.

108,draez8l,"Why do we need State Channels?
 
Scaling Ethereum is a subject on everyone's lips.  Bitcoin currently does 2-3 transactions per second on-chain Ethereum has had its gas limits raised to cope with a hefty 10 transactions per second  and were waiting for more exotic scaling solutions like Plasma and Casper-Sharding, in order to reach faster tps in the hundreds or thousands of tps.   But we can achieve much faster, and sooner, without such exotic and risky solutions.

State Channels can deliver significant scaling benefits and run on todays ethereum and weve invested the engineering time to create working implementations of these technologies so that we can deploy our games sooner and reach the marketplace today and not have to wait for tomorrow.
 
Weve already seen that one simple cat trading app can make a significant dent on transaction fees and network delays   but it doesn't need to be this way.
 
Weve developed the Fate Channel tech to allow us to cope with hundreds or thousands of transactions per second, allowing large numbers of people to play games in realtime on the blockchain, with the right amount of on chain and off chain transacttransactions all seamlessly integrated together.
 
This is the first of several blogs that FunFair's CTO (Jeremy Longley) is writing on the technology.  Our point is that it doesnt need to be exotic to deliver measurable scaling benefits, today!   FunFair¨¹s Fate Channels have been live since June, and continue to improve in capability each month.  We¨¹re on version 3, which deliver multi-state games and fast gameplay while maintaining the lightest load on the ethereum network.

34,dralfva,"This is a positive way to approach ethereum. Last days we've seen various ways of dealing with scalability from the perspective of dApps developers:

(1) **Wait and see**: developers who are not in a hurry or-and dApp requirements are very demanding, complex or special may prefer to wait until mainnet is fast enough to implement a production of their dApp on ethereum. Akasha, Status, and many other;

(2) **All in**: developers prefer to release their dApp without much concern about capacity and scalability, probably not expecting a lot of success so the impact won't be too big. This is Cryptokitties. The simplicity of the dApp makes it easier to just port it to the mainnet and see what happens. At first hand, developers don't seem to be much concerned about the impact on traffic, until it happens then solutions need to be found;

(3) **Quit**: some others become frustrated or just annoyed by the speed of the network and conclude that ethereum is not good for their projects. They look for other alternatives which they think are more adapted to their needs. This is Kin, who just announced they will be moving to stellar, because ehereum is ""trying to be everything to everybody, and that makes it general-purpose and slow."" They just don't realise that ethereum is what the developers wants it to be, that's the beauty of it, you can do whatever you want with it because is turing complete, if it's too slow just innovate and the possibilities are immense;

(4) **DIY**: ethereum is above all a computer, as such it can be programmed according to our needs and its current capabilities. This makes the role of the developer and their inventiveness and creativity very relevant to use it at its most with a gradual increase in capabilities and functionalities. The amazing thing of ethereum is that the more 'uses' the better the technology and the dApps become, due to the network effect where a solution for one may benefit the many. This has been from the beginning FunFair's approach. They want the decentralisation, flexibility and openness of ethereum, and if there are things that cannot be done now, solutions can be developed to make it possible using its current capabilities and functionalities.",2017-12-16 00:17:00

**Edit 1:**

Came back to the servers after a few hours and one got stuck, one crashed with a backtrace. Continue with blockchain sync.

**Edit 2:**

Very generic initial instructions. Will update later with more extensive guide.

1. Get any 64bit OS installation on any server provider of your choosing.
2. [Install Docker](https:--docs.docker.com-engine-installation) for the OS of your choosing.
3. Once installed run Geth `docker run -it -p 30303:30303 -p  30304:30304 -v -home-ethereum:-root-.ethereum ethereum-client-go:stable --lightserv 80 --lightpeers 200 --maxpeers 200`
This line requires a bit of tweaking depending on your setup. 
`-p 30303:30303` tells you to forward remote port 30303 to local port 30303. (the same for the RLPx v5 port 30304) `-v -home-ethereum:-root-.ethereum` this tells you to store the Ethereum data from the docker container on the remote hos in the -home-ethereum folder. If you want to store it somewhere else change the path. 
`--lightserv 80` tells that 80% of the time should be used for light requests. `--lightpeers 200` amount of peers to support. `--maxpeers 200` needs to be set to the same amount as lightpeers as it seems to only allow 25 peers (the default otherwise). Tweak these values to your server's available resources.
4. Done! I think... Still waiting on my own installations to finish so I can further tweak it :)

**Edit 3:**

Still importing new state entries... Sadly there doesn't seem to be an accurate way to tell how long this process lasts. 

**Edit 4:**

First server (US-East region) is finished with a 48GB chain. You can add it with
`admin.addPeer(""enode:--b7fd43a70b9de121adf6e771ac11acd1c92225c521bb99b7f29ed598057e015eb233b84b1b9981d8f505ba70bd8e6b240b87a0c35e0d59fb8fbf5f11c8c13a11@104.196.192.158:30303"")`

It might go down as I reboot and clone the server across other regions, or at least attempt to :)

**Edit 5:**

Asia-East is now online `admin.addPeer(""enode:--b7fd43a70b9de121adf6e771ac11acd1c92225c521bb99b7f29ed598057e015eb233b84b1b9981d8f505ba70bd8e6b240b87a0c35e0d59fb8fbf5f11c8c13a11@104.199.160.187:30303"")`

31,drcer0v,"> Suppose that the variable c denotes the level of computational power available to one node. In a simple blockchain, the transaction capacity is bounded by O(c), as every node must process every transaction. The goal of quadratic sharding is to increase the capacity with a two-layer design. Stage 1 requires no hard forks; the main chain stays exactly as is. However, a contract is published to the main chain called the validator manager contract (VMC), which maintains the sharding system. There are O(c) shards (currently, 100), where each shard is like a separate ""galaxy"": it has its own account space, transactions need to specify which shard they are to be published inside, and communication between shards is very limited (in fact, in phase 1, it is nonexistent).

> The shards are run on a simple longest-chain-rule proof of stake system, where the stake is on the main chain (specifically, inside the VMC). All shards share a common validator pool; this also means that anyone who signs up with the VMC as a validator could theoretically at any time be assigned the right to create a block on any shard. Each shard has a block size-gas limit of O(c), and so the total capacity of the system is O(c^2).

Am I understanding this correctly?

- Each shard is effectively a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain.
- The VMC implements yet another blockchain (a meta-blockchain?) inside a smart contract.
- The shards ""settle up"" between each other when validators being managed by the VMC put transactions into blocks on the meta-blockchain.
- The meta-blockchain is secured among validators by proof-of-stake, where staking probability increases with shard-chain-length.

edit: more stuff from later on:

- The blocks on the main chain contain ""collations"". A collation is itself a ledger of transactions that took place on a particular shard.
- Validators are not assigned to shards, but can opt-in to watch multiple shards. When called upon to create a block on the main chain under the VMC, a validator must generate a collation by scanning that shard's block history.",2017-12-17 03:14:00

30,drgchxf,"I'm gonna take a shot at explaining for people that don't see a use case here.

I'm going to use a couple of the examples given in the [Dai Whitepaper](https:--makerdao.com-whitepaper-DaiDec17WP.pdf):

> * **Example 1:** Bob needs a loan, so he decides to generate 100 Dai. He locks an amount of ETH worth significantly more than 100 Dai into a CDP and uses it to generate 100 Dai. The 100 Dai is instantly sent directly to his Ethereum account. Assuming that the stability fee is 1% per year, Bob will need 101 Dai to cover the CDP if he decides to review his ETH one year later.

This is pretty self explanatory. If you're wondering why would you put up more collateral than the loan is worth, do you want to spend your Ether, or hold it to appreciate in value? Presumably the 101 Dai will be cost less Ether when it's time to pay off the loan when it was issued.

> * **Example 2:** Bob wishes to go margin long the ETH-Dai pair, so he generates 100 USD worth of Dai by posting 150 USD wroth of ETH to a CDP. He then buys another 100 USD worth of ETH with his newly generated Dai, giving him a new 1.66x ETH-USD exposure. He's free to do whatever he wants with the 100 USD worth of ETH he obtained by selling the Dai. The original ETH collateral (150 USD worth) remains locked in the CDP until the debt plus the Stability Fee is covered.

Now here things get interesting. Simply put, going long means you expect the asset to appreciate in value throughout the duration of your exposure. So how does it work here? Let's throw in some numbers. ETH is currently at ~800 USD, so $150 would be roughly 0.1875 ETH. You go margin long and get 100 DAI ($100) against your 0.1875 ETH and immediately go spend all that on ETH (0.125 ETH @ $800). Some time goes by and Ether, as you hoped, had gone up to $1000-coin. Time to close your trade. You go trade ETH for Dai (remember the 1% fee) and cough up 0.101 ETH to get your 0.1875 ETH back. Okay, lets recap what you just did: You used 0.101 ETH to buy 0.125 ETH, that's a nice 23.7% profit on top of the 25% profit of Ether going from $800->$1000. GO LONG. HODL TO THE MOON.

That's it for now since I'm deciphering this as I go, and the next two examples are a bit more complicated and I have things to do. If ya'll are interested, I'm likely going to write a blogpost about this later on describing Dai and applications in detail.

Then, we can actually just throw out all the cryptocurrency stuff as it's now not needed; all that's left is an online service run by the cryptokitties' creator.

Worst part of this is that you could have done everything right to protect yourself: ledger, private keys, triple check the address and the ssl certificate, etc--but you still would get burned.

I can never use ED again now. It's just too risky.


Fortunately, however, crypto is becoming more mainstream and hacking a DNS will leave more of a trail than a hacking a single address or a jacking someone's keys. I hope that very soon the hacker will be identified and brought to justice.

I understand that the private key to my wallet on Coinbase is stored with them. I use my credentials and 2FA to access this. A safer option is to control my own Private key which led me to MEW. 

What happens when I open a wallet on a site like MEW? When I open a wallet I set a Password for my UTC file, I can download my encrypted UTC File as well as copying or writing down my private key (plus hardware wallets but i do not own them right). I can either open my wallet with the UTC File and PW or the private key. Is this access method restricted to MEW? Or is MEW just the interface to the blockchain and I could use the same private key - UTC file on a wallet like MIST? 

To go even further into my questions: Reading into hardware wallets I understand that my private key is encrypted on the wallet plus I need to enter a PIN as well as confirm the transactions on the little usb-dongle. What happens in the case that little USB-dongle has a malfunction, a software update doesn't work, the company producing the dongle goes bankrupt etc. Is there a way to change the access method i.e. from hardware wallet to simple private key? Hence wouldn't it be safer in terms of independence to restrict to paper print private key?

4,drnw2tf,"It needs to be pointed out what ""edgeless"" means.

It might not be apparent to people who know little about gambling, but allow me to elaborate a little.

In gambling the house has a huge edge. Take roulette (because the math is the easiest) for example.

There are 38 numbers, 18 of them red, 18 of them black, 2 green. You can bet x amount of money on red, black or single numbers (and a bunch of other things, but for simplicity I will ignore those, the payoffs are of a size that the same principle applies).

The payoff are as follows: bet x on black, if black you get 2x, if not black you get 0. So that means your expected value is (18-38)*2x for a bet of x. that is an EV of about .84. So for every bet, on average you lose 16% of your bet.

So lets say you spend 10 minutes playing and you bet 5$ on red 30 times, on average you are going to have about 126$. 

So you are paying the casino on average 24$ for the ability to play the game for 10 minutes betting 5$. This is completely unreasonable. 

Edgeless will be completely rakefree, according to their website. That is an insane advantage over its competition (online casinos). Once enough people realize this online casinos can go die (the faster the better IMHO). The online gambling market has grown every year, with it currently being about 47 billion usd.

I'm guessing that there's something about the details of how the txpool works that prevents this from happening in one block but I'd be curious to know what that actually is.

It ought to be possible to sweep in the same block, by setting your gas price 1 wei lower than the target transaction's gas price.

Perhaps existing sweepers are just watching the blockchain, rather than the pending pool, for new transactions to their target addresses?

10,drpxuk3,"> There are payments made to Genesis from this account so it seems reasonable that this is paying for a cloud miner but I'm not familiar enough with the setups of cloud miners to understand how one can decide to include zero gas price transactions in their own.

At rent-a-hash services, one usually purchases ""grind workers"" (normalised to ""average hashing power you will get for a given amount of time""). Actual mining farm contracts, I'd guess, are a bit more convoluted, but would boil down to the same.

So, in this case, one would set up an Ethereum node that would construct blocks to specification, including the zero-fee transactions (possibly signed remotely, but could be on the same machine).

The block header - already containing the transactions! - would then be sent to a ""mining pool proxy"" (possibly remote machine, but maybe also the same one). The proxy doles out the header to workers, which connect from the remote rent-a-hash provider.

Once a worker finds a solution, it is sent back through the pool proxy to the node, which then publishes the block.

So

> So 957 waits for their GPUs to mine a block, and immediately adds ~5 zero gas price transactions to the normal selection of txpool transactions picked up by their node, sweeping tokens to the 957 account and submitting it normally.

is not required: the grinders are already working on a block that contains the transactions.

And thank you for the effort! This has been a highly enjoyable read.

I had only two goals this year at family gatherings: explain the blockchain, and explain how mining works.

For the former, I asked my family to imagine the world was full of accountants who all worked for different firms, and that there was a giant log (ledger) of all transactions between people and businesses, and that every accountant got a copy of this ledger. Then imagine that for every one of those transactions, a certain number of those accountants had to agree that the math was correct and that the money did change hands correctly. They do this by being on a giant, ongoing conference call with all the other accountants.

Then I just explained that ""blockchain"" was just a name for this giant ledger, and that transactions on the blockchain are all verified by nodes on the network, aka virtual accountants all double-checking the exchanges.

For mining, I asked my family to imagine a schoolroom full of children and a teacher at the front of the room. The teacher has a big bag of tootsie rolls, and he writes a math problem on the board. Each of the students feverishly works out the problem, and the first student to come up with the answer reads their answer aloud, and the rest of the students check his work. If he's correct, he gets a reward -- some tootsie rolls that the teacher hands him. For each new math problem, the number of tootsie rolls you get as a reward gets smaller. Some students work together, ""pooling resources"" to solve the problem. One group of students gets the answer first, submits it, its verified, and they get 10 tootsie rolls that they then have to share amongst themselves. The leader of the group gets a little extra because he submitted the answer on behalf of the group. More time passes, and word gets out that ""Hey! This teacher is handing out candy for math problems!"" More students join the class, and suddenly it's much harder to get a reward. In this case, the teacher is asking questions that are more quickly solved on a graphing calculator, so the first kids to realize that and start using them jump ahead and start getting tons of tootsie rolls. It becomes so hard for some of the students to keep up that they take their current winnings and leave the class. Or they may just choose to stick around and verify other peoples' work because they enjoy it or they believe in what the teacher is trying to do.

Then I tell them that the teacher is a type of crypto network, that the tootsie rolls are the cryptocurrency itself, the rules of the game and the type of problems are the algorithm used, the students are miners, and the graphing calculators are ASICs. I don't tell them this quite this rapidly, because I'd lose them, but you get the idea.

Analogies are the easiest way to explain things to people most of the time. And whether or not they truly get it at first soak, they'll eventually absorb some of it, and in the meantime, it won't seem mystical and scary anymore. They also know they can ask you about it and you won't make them feel like shit for doing so. Always a good thing. :)",2017-12-26 14:22:00

Vitalik has undoubtedly suffered enough as a founder, as the first one through the breach. Hes had to prove his ideas to non-believers with nothing to gain by bashing him, just demanding solid proof. Now he has to suffer 2 different levels of attackers. 

The first level is the clown who just wants a quick laugh at the expense of something he doesnt understand. As easy as it is to dismiss these fools, they can still manage to slip a knife in and nick and sting and a thousand of them can kill either the body or the spirit. 

The second level is the paid assassin. There can be no doubt the very institutions Ethereum and all good crypto currencies threaten have operatives working as hard as they can to get as close as they can to kill if not the body, at least the spirit. 

Andreas Antonopoulos has said of these, First they ignore us, then they (the clowns) ridicule us, then they (the assassins) fight us, then we win. He left out the part about causalities. We dont all get to see the win, and the first one through the breach rarely does. 

So, I would say this y this to Vitalik. First, if you can¨¹t ignore the fools, it¨¹s time for a vacation. You don¨¹t have to put your head in the sand, but go put your toes in some and order something expensive delivered to your beach towel. Rinse and repeat and read the papers again when you¨¹re up to it. Second, a healthy dose of paranoia is not a bad thing. Keep fresh batteries in your bullshit detector. Every day, the bull¨¹s-eye on your back grows bigger. Not all assassins wear black and kill with violence. Some of them will certainly be paid to look like a clown and kill with a cutting jest.

Let them talk, they will have to come around. Only possibility which I see for crypto to fail, would be if democratic countries decide to ban. And then it would still win out in long-term I think, because the utility seems to be too great, especially for countries not very developed. Still, seems very unlikely the E.U and the U.S e.t.c will go for a ban, and as long as they don't ban, there will be a safe haven for all the rest of the crypto world to come to. It already happened, from what I understand, with many Chinese crypto companies that had to close down.

But can you blame them for not understanding? Like, I've known of crypto for many years, but only about Bitcoin. I also thought about it the way they think about it. Then I began reading more in-depth during September, and quite extensively for the last 5 weeks. It's not easy to understand crypto. It is its own kind of world, and it's very hard to come to any real conclusion on certain tokens. Still, they shouldn't be shit-talking it, but research.

First of all, there is not ONE mainstream media. The usage of the term applies homogenity while in fact it, as any human contruct, is given a face by people. People like you and me that have to go to the toilet once in a while and sleep under a blanket at night. You know: regular people.

Secondly, there are absolutely zero instances of big corporations, government bodies or wealthy individuals that pay for a story. It simply DOES NOT happen. What does happen is the following:

- A story breaks. Sometimes it acute news (terrorist strike f.e.) but most of the time it comes from people with an agenda. Mind you: not the devil, people that want attention for something. Maybe its a product disguised as a trend, maybe it is a cause disguised as an single opinion.
- The editor calls the people that know about this and ALSO tries to find someone that is outside of the people that want to push the story, but can give you an 'expert view'. This is why you get killed to death in news stories with 'experts'.
- The story is pitched to a central person, an editor-in-chief if you will. He or she will weigh the story: does it fit our show and is there other more important news? Is it something people need to hear (dangerous, impactful etc)
- The story airs and people comment on it, coming back to the same issue from different angles. #MeToo was a great example, the amount of views was nearly endless (gays, men, sex-experts, lawyers etc etc). 

Why is BitCoin viewed badly? Because the expert-step are people that are not into crypto and 'danger sells', see the editor-in-chief.

So: there is no conspiracy. There is misinformation and the job of any journalist is to give the public a balanced situation report.

7,drw0u8h,"It is not surprising.

(I hope this post doesn't count as ""go to ethtrader"")

The whole of cryptocurrency is in a massive speculative bubble where the valuations have totally overshot the current value which the technology is delivering.

See ""Have we earned it?"" Tweet from Vitalik:

https:--twitter.com-VitalikButerin-status-940744724431982594

Much of this value is going into Bitcoin, which is the worst of all the major cryptocurrencies in terms of technology.

Bitcoin Core have conclusively demonstrated in the last few months that they will never scale on-chain and have let fees get out of all control.   Mike Hearn was spot on.  The Bitcoin Cash hardfork only happened after two years of stalemate and civil war.   I think that even if Bitcoin Cash can restore the original vision, that it is likely already too late for them to recover all that lost ground.  Look what Ethereum has achieved in that time.

But Bitcoin (Core) is where all the new speculative money goes because people have heard of Bitcoin and think ""that is the best one"".   Just FOMO and seeking yield.  Pure speculation completely divorced from the completely unusable state of Bitcoin for anything other than speculation.

I called out Bitcoin on Twitter a few weeks ago as having turned into a ponzi scheme, but Cody Burns and Preston Byrne had a better name: ""Satoshi Scheme""

https:--prestonbyrne.com-2017-12-08-bitcoin_ponzi-

I see huge value in Ethereum technology as the rails for all kinds of cryptoassets, dapps, and public-consortium-private permissioned chains.

I see value in zk-snarks and truly anonymous cryptocurrencies as the new digital cash - bearer assets, for citizens in failing states like Venezuela.

But Bitcoin and ICO froth will tar the whole of the cryptocurrency ecosystem for years to come, IMHO.

Looks like like Dotcom era to me.   The birth of a revolution, but massively oversold and overhyped given the state of the technology.    Will be great in a year or two.  Not there yet.

Listen to what Andreas has been saying years.  Ignore the speculation and price.  Learn about the technology.

I only call this out because the people who will be hurt in the inevitable pending crash will be those least able to afford the loss.   Average or poorer than average people just looking to get out of a hole, because their friends told them about Bitcoin and they piled in just recently.   Sometimes on credit.   With no knowledge of what they were buying or what blockchain even is.   The whales will be fine.   They will get out and profit all the way.

It is the minnows who will get whacked.  And it is those normal people which the potential for social impact of blockchain should ultimately benefit the most.

It really makes me sick to the pit of my stomach to see this happen.   Anyway.  I've said my piece.  Bob out.

Unfortunately the so called capitalistic approach tries to ignore the source of our well being: labour, resources of raw materials, services, ... and a lot of people talk like having money is being rich. Try eating money when you're hungry and you will see what I mean. There's an age old story about a king who wished everything he touches turned into gold. He died shortly after his wish was fulfilled...

I hope in deciding the future development of Ethereum, decisions will plain ignore the ideas of those who are in Ethereum pure as a money gaining investment. Decisions should be made to make the Ethereum blockchain as useable and practical as possible. 

If you look at Bitcoin on this moment: the value has risen not because it became so practical, but because it is failing. It is impossible that all the money pumped into BTC will ever get exchanged back to fiat. And I would not even think about accepting BTC as a means of payment for any goods or services I sell either.
Knowing that Bitcoin is no more than a means of exchange (for goods or other currency), everyone who is only a little sane can smell what will happen, unless Bitcoin can solve the problem of slowness & high fees in a very short term. If only a few people would have invested in bitcoins this wouldn't be a problem, but senseless 'popularity' drawed so much attention of people who actually have no clue, and only a few will make 'profit' at the end. Profit that in fact serves no one except those few...
Remember the economic value of something is nothing more than the price the biggest fool wants to pay for it... the real value is something you can't push.

The real value is only there if you can exchange the currency (fiat-crypto-anything else) for something you actually need. As long as it's a number in a graph, you can cheer as much as you want, you only cheer about air (well, actually about 'ether'-void, as air is something you actually need).

I hope the value of ETH will not rise the same way as bitcoin and instead it will become (or stay, imho;) the best worked out blockchain tech around (mainly due to it's founders actually having a view on how the world turns around). I see blockchain technology as an immature thing right now. Promises a lot, but we are not there yet. I hope mr.

Its why we see such draconian censorship, dirty tricks, lies, and diabolical political tactics.](https:--www.reddit.com-r-btc-comments-7d02ee-some_thoughts_about_the_possible_bitcoin_segwit-)",2017-12-31 21:51:00

I don't have the numbers but Parity at 26e4fc6 easily took 60 hours, CPU at 100% and Disk write at >60% the entire time...not good for your computer. Currently takes up 50gb

In the Parity network configuration page they state:
 >Parity utilizes the network aggressively which allows finding and connecting to peers quickly.

Another way of saying that it's going to rape your bandwidth. I had to limit the amount of peers because of the amount of connections being made to my machine, and to be honest I don't trust a single one of them.

If I were to do this again I would run it on a workstation or gaming rig then transfer the database to a remote or home server and serve a client from there.

13,ds0904m,I am new to the crypto scene. I dont have a lot to offer but im super excited for 2018. Ethereum is my first crypto and will also be the first platform i develop on. Have a great new years everyone cant wait to see what these communities produce. ,2018-01-01 03:20:00
30,ds0ad4m,"I started investing in crypto the day the news spread about Parity developer devops199 freezing $230 million in Ethereum. I bought 1.5 ETH at $291 each. Prior to that I had mined about 7k gridcoin in 2015, but wasn't seriously invested in crypto.

Since then I have been putting ever dollar I can spare into crypto, researching white papers, dev teams, and applying the same discipline that I apply to the other investments I've made over my lifetime. Also, I've made a point to actually use the tech these assets provide. For example, just yesterday I funded a 2.1 ETH loan on a decentralized P2P lending platform, I paid someone money I owed them with LTC ( which I no longer hold), and starting tomorrow I will be receiving a rent payment in ETH.

My initial portfolio distribution was 85% ETH, and 15% whatever other crypto seemed worth owning, with a small percentage of that invested in long term highly speculative investments. Because of how well that 15% did, my portfolio is currently only 75% ETH (largely due selling XRP after a 550% return). I will rebalance my portfolio back to 85% ETH once the opportunity presents itself.

I love crypto so much more than investing in stocks, mutual funds, bonds, and traditional derivatives. We live in exciting times, and crypto is transforming so much of our world at once. I'm excited to see what the future brings.",2018-01-01 03:47:00

Paper wallets are meant to be single use only, only withdraw once from it. Use a hot wallet on your phone, something like coinomi for multiple divying out transactions.

The creator of MEW made a good post on wallet and crypto security. The best practice for paper wallets is download MEW and load it onto an air gapped computer and print using an air gapped printer. You can create an encrypted archive using 7-zip on the air gapped computer, use a random string 20-40 chars long and print that from the computer too. Keep it safe.

Our citizens are going digital and global. If the state doesn't keep up it will become obsolete, The Telegraph

16.07.2017

By Kersti Kaljulaid

As the President of Estonia, I represent the only truly digital society which actually has a state. And this position has made me question whether the state as we know it today is fit for the 21st century.

Traditionally nations have harnessed taxpayers to their territory by making almost everything people need from society dependent on working in one country, every day of the week, all months of the year and for at least three decades to receive these social guarantees. In creating free movement of people, the web has only got more complex, but never disappeared. The same old story of where you live, where you work and where you are entitled to get the social benefits.

The world around all these political debates is radically changing, industrial jobs are disappearing. They will continue to disappear, because of the productivity gains that come from choosing to invest in machinery and automation over people. Thus, social models that were created to fit industrial and early service economies will no longer be viable. It is only in Alice in Wonderland that the cat can leave while the grin lingers. In the real world when the cat is gone, the grin vanishes with it. Put simply, as the industrial workforce shrinks  just as we once saw happen in agriculture  the social model founded on it will go, too.

My son, an IT specialist, works for several companies at a same time. In some of them he is an owner, in others an employee. When he travels to others states for months at a time for work, he normally rents out his home assets  a flat, a car, sometimes even his dog (a well-trained Labrador who can keep lonely older people company).

Another man I know, a talented craftsman making world class bows and arrows, lives in rural Estonia. He came from South Africa. He did not lose any of his clients, even if he now makes his products at least 100 kilometres from his nearest customer.

And, of course, we all know how some people make a living posting on YouTube and other global broadcasting networks.

There are more and more people who work totally independently from any one company, any one country or any singular social model.

Old jobs are disappearing. New ones are emerging. Some are truly new, products of the digital ageage. Others are reformulations of the old: the craftsman with his bows and the jester on YouTube, who gain leverage from the global digital space. 100 years ago, the craftsmen needed to travel local fairs to trade their goods. In the 20th century, deals with a souvenir shop or a big retailer were struck. Now, they are able to reach all their global clients cheaply, efficiently and at low cost.

Most new jobs created by global digital opportunities are making people more independent than they were before. Fewer and fewer people will work for one company at a time or in the same country all the time. More and more people work remotely across borders.

This poses difficult questions for our joint liberal, democratic societies, accustomed to guaranteeing our people education, healthcare, security, and so on.

Which country's social and education system has to provide for a global worker? Where must it provide it? How can states tax these free spirits, our citizens? We have not yet figured out how to regulate and tax multinational companies, how on earth will we manage with our citizens going individually global?

Yet manage we must. We must figure out how to offer people the security that makes them want to remain taxpayers. We must overcome geography and ingrown habits of offering regular social support for regular tax payments  usually coming from a company with a local address.

If we fail, we will lose the attention of our citizens. For example: traditionally, governments have held a monopoly over the provision of safe identification by issuing passports. Today, with national governments having been late to cyberspace, there are alternatives. Google now offers a digital time-stamped identification to its users. There are very few countries who can provide the same service (Estonia is one of them).

Similarly, if governments cling to the old industrial model of social guarantees for too long, someone else will step in. We might lose our universal systems of redistribution, thus making states in many ways obsolete. To avoid this fate, we must think how to offer our global citizens a safe harbour, an opportunity to teach their children, and receive social services and healthcare wherever they chose to live or work.

Thinking from this 21st century perspective, Brexit loses its relevance. We are still all in it together. We must resspond to our citizens' changing opportunities and habits. It must all become rather more flexible than we know it in the current common market. Yes, we must have intermediate solutions for this and maybe the next decade.

3,dschrlp,"great question!

i think about this stuff a lot. youre following the right path, but you have to understand that it will take decades. maybe you and me wont even see some scenarios of some thoughts mentioned in this thread. technology accelerated us to such an speed, that people cant keep up with. just as i see the world right now totally different than my parents, and my parents may have a lot of opinions, habbits, traits, knowledge and experiences, which dont fit with the current world. their circumstances and the technology they grew up with but also the way they grew up moral-wise or understanding of things is just fundamentally different than ours. thats not necessarily bad - its just outdated. their parents maybe did too, just like their grandparents. im talking about politics, im talking about religion. im talking about parenting, and on perception of purpose in life, happiness, education. the list goes on and on. technology fucked everything up, in the most possible way in my opinion.

so much changed over the past 10 years since the smartnce the smartphone, and a lot more changed over the past 20 years since the internet. cryptocurrencies and blockchain is not just going to be world-changing - it already has changed the world. it just takes time, and perspective as well as experience, to grasp how long this actually takes. take a look at ecommerce. i dont buy shit anymore in stores for years now, and more and more people arent either, still only about 10-15% of things are bought online, and were 20 years in and compared to what the blockchain can and will do with our world, commerce is just a small piece of the pie. our ecosystem, the whole money system which is slowly flipping, our communication .. everything and every task will be eaten up by technology, AI and blockchain. every government system, the education system, the health system as already mentioned in the comments, politics, the understanding of states - the list goes on and on - everything is constantly and will dramatically change. 

if you start to think that far, you realize that our current world, laws, rules, lifestyles - pick any thing you want - are ancient, compared to were technology and the distribution-explosion combined with the ways in which we are connected all over the world will carry us. a lot of things have to happen, and a lot of people arent comfortable with change.

It's a huge source of inefficiency and unrest and violence to lock up specific resources behind an arbitrary line on a map we call a ""border"" and then go to war over it instead. Almost all wars are money-making ventures. Every war America has been in since WW2 has been about stealing shit from other people, basically. 

It's going to take upheaval to get from one type of society to another, and cryptocurrencies really do strike at the heart of the old system, the fiat money world and the banks. The people in Government are mostly figureheads, in place to do the bidding of their corporate lords and masters. 

I'm mostly in crypto myself though because I'm tired of being poor. The poor are very unfree thanks to how the system is set up. The few victimize the many, that's human society in a nutshell and has been forever. We could do much better. 

We have the technology and the knowhow to run the entire world on a more ""solid state"" basis - literally tracking resources (using blockchains...) and resource requests-needs directly. To me it seems like common sense to just have a society that regiments the resources according to real world need and solid priorities, and leaves people entirely free to do anything they want, with only the most minimal rules enforced - like ""you can't do anything that hurts society at large or other people, other than that, live where you want and do what you want.""

1,dscyrlf,"I know this isn't exactly a direct response to your post, but I was mulling over the idea of your thread all day and had a shower thoughts-type moment stoke me. 


Right now, a relatively small portion of the population is involved with crypto. And in the last couple years, the valuation of Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, etc have skyrocketed. As such the word is getting out, and not just more people but also more projects are being built on these currency foundations. The price (theoretically) should keep going up, and are turning early adopters and even medium adopters wealthy. People are and will cash out with their massive gains, and buy property-businesses-vehicles-what have you. If that cycle keeps happening, and it keeps rising in value, could it not have a huge snowball effect and start to devalue paper currency? 


From what I've read about hyper-inflation, it is typically the government's fault by increasingly printing money and devaluing the currency. Could crypto's exponential rise in value and subsequent trading for paper money negatively effect the value of said paper money? If the number of multimillionaires in the US for example goes up exponentially, would that not lower the buying power of the USD? And if that did happen, how fast would that type of devaluing take? Would the country be able to cope or would the change become too much to deal with? Would that kind of devaluation of the USD effect other major fiat currencies?

Why else would anyone forego the safety net (albeit an inefficient and time-consuming) of centuries worth of case law and precedent? Contract law is not as simple as ""if A then B"". If it were a way to filter it down in such a way, there would be no need for judicial process. 

Judicial protections may seem like a nuisance and costly, but they exist for a reason no matter how much some people in the business world would like to legislate them away.

This reminds me of the MERS system in a way. This was the electronic system that attempted to ""bypass"" the traditional recording systems-statutes in each state. You may recall the ""robo-signing"" (i.e., automating--without following required protocols--the foreclosure petition process) litigation resulted in billion-dollar settlements by banks employing this. 

We all want a better mousetrap. Efficiency is an effective means to pursue such a goal. However, efficiency absent adequate protections for those on each side of the equation will not work. This model might make sense in theory, but in practice it puts your grandmother on the street when she misses her payment because she was hospitalized, it allows for unsupervised foreclosures, and looks like a recipe for disaster.

Crypto Zombies is an online tutorial by Loom Network. Currently at Lesson 2 with Lesson 3 due soon. You build a smart contract for a non-fungible asset (eventually build a dApp in future lessons), think CryptoKitties. So far over 35,000 students. 

Truffle is a popular framework for developing smart contracts. Pet Shop is an easy to follow and walks you through the truffle process including a smart contract, tests for the smart contract and a dApp. You also get to use MetaMask (thank you Orange Fox team).  If you do want to develop smart contracts then you may likely use truffle. 

Ethernaut is a series of challenges where you will have to teach yourself about smart contract security. Along the way you could use Remix. Apart from being fun, you will have to read and interact with smart contracts and think about security issues. Open Zeppelin is an open source collection of smart contracts to build on that I would recommend using for development.

I saw the [following comment on HN yesterday](https:--news.ycombinator.com-item?id=16108689):
>A couple weeks ago a startup pitched blockchain solutions for government problems (I work at a government agency in Brazil). The presentation sounded like Scientology, lots of circular arguments and bold claims without much substance.
I asked a few questions and he dodged them like a professional politician:

>* what do you do if you need to reverse a transaction (lets say, court order)

>* what if someone loses his wallet-password

>* some people claims blockchain is over-hyped

>He said that I being skeptical proves my ignorance and I should study more about the subject instead of challenge him.

>Remembered the short tale ""The Emperor's new clothes"", I'm unable to see the king's clothes because they are made of a magic fabric invisible to the stupid. I guess the magic fabric is made of blockchain.

I can't verify this comment, but I'd believe it.  Until there is a more concrete source from the Brazilian government saying ""we're doing this"" or even ""we're looking at this""  (this article provides no such source), I wouldn't get too excited.",2018-01-11 01:12:00

8,dshn9mw,"In Brazil, by constitution, if your petition receives 1% of the population's signature it will be officially discussed in Congress, and it can become a law (it has been done before).

It is an important tool, and the population is very active at creating petitions (we usually use avaaz or change.org).

The problem is that online petitions are an easy target for sybil attacks, so the signatures collected online are not considered in the 1% Constitution magic number. Instead what usually happens is that online petitions with lots of signatures usually find a congressmen to ""sponsor"" them and push the agenda. It's an imperfect solution whilst we have a much better one in our constitution.

Smart contracts and digitally verified IDs+signatures can change that and bring ""legal recognition"" for online petitions. This is the iniciative described in the article. It is somewhat recent, from some insiders in our legal system.

It is a movement that need the approval of current legislators and legacy system, and is of course a very hard thing to work on (in Brazil on anywhere else).

If it works, it will be a very nice laboratory for broader uses for ID'ed voting like the elections themselves. If it fails to be approved, it was another step towards the correct direction.

The main point is that those kind of Crypto governance-political iniciatives are becoming a reality, whether in the first or the third world.",2018-01-11 06:01:00

- BOPE: Tropa De Elite 1 and 2 (fucking amazing action movies with underlying themes central to the issues Brazil faces, which a better voting system would impact)
- City of God (good insight into how the vast majority of Brazilians live day to day, even now)

Voting in Brazil is MANDATORY, its not a right, its the law. This, at face value, seems to make some sense (maybe) but in-fact voting itself becomes political currency; ""Hey poor people living in cardboard houses in a mudslide zone with no pot to shit in, if you vote for me I'll give you and your shit neighborhood discounted cable access for a month!"" This type of shit happens down there to the point where they elect former communist terrorists (Dilma) into power and then the country has to deal with whats happened there over the past 20 fucking years even though they're the 8th-7th largest economy in the WORLD. 

Oh wait, this applies in the USA too haha stupid fuck middle America and white supremacists voted Trump into power, even though the asshole now has a 30% approval rating... what happened to the other 70%? They were either too lazy to go to the voting polls because they can't vote from their finger tips on their iPhone yet, or because vote day in the USA is a regular Capitalist day; we dont even get the day off... so the minority communities and those working for The Man are unable to leave work to go vote because they'll get fired or it will look bad to skip out on work and do their civic duty.... yea yea and the only other viable candidate is a sellout crook but honestly, she at least provides a better reality than Trump ever could.

If it is going to disrupt industries who don't adopt to it, how can the industries adopt it while still being centralized. Meaning use the platform but still only allow identified parties (permissioned) to access it only.

Since the data is stored in all the computers, I assume it will still need internet and power, what if someone hacks a powergrid,, wouldn't then all the service be stopped-inaccessible?

What about cyber security and  threats from malicious attacks, how will those work with Ethereum?

Lightning has serious [scaling issues](https:--np.reddit.com-r-btc-comments-74ss0w-another_all_time_low_achieved_the_blockstream_cso-do0voa8) because millions of users imply that tons of changes per second must be broadcast and tons of routes recomputed every second, which is [impossible](https:--np.reddit.com-r-ethtrader-comments-7n00gv-daily_general_discussion_december_30_2017-dryqkxc).

Participants need to leave their computer [on permanently, with private keys on the hard disk](https:--np.reddit.com-r-Bitcoin-comments-7l5bqj-the_best_thing_that_you_can_do_to_help_ensure). That is against the security basics of Bitcoin: it makes massive hacks and thefts easy.

Using it requires [complicated, expensive and slow actions](https:--np.reddit.com-r-btc-comments-7nomn8-reasons_why_lightning_will_not_work).

If Lightning could work, it would anyway kill Bitcoin's point: *a decentralised network for censorship-proof transactions* (each person would open only one channel with a central hub that everyone connects to and transacts through, instead of peer to peer channels, because two transactions are needed to open and close a Lightning channel, which are very expensive).

So, among censorable networks, PayPal is clearly safer and simpler to use for everybody (and it can scale up).",2018-01-13 18:19:00

Looks like there are 1986 addresses (so far) that received ETH from this address.

It looks like, for some reason, when they're done, they send their remaining balance to the address being sent the transactions. So it would appear that the address being sent the transactions is owned by whoever is doing this.

Looks like this one https:--etherscan.io-address-0x5f42801ac21677008433d70f1060831ff2a04602 is involved as well, or was about 38 days ago, because it sent 0.0123064 ETH to many of the addresses that are sending the empty transactions.  So this did not start today.

Looking through at random transactions from this one, it has sent lots more transactions to many addresses of different amounts (but all the same for a given time frame). It appears that price or gas limit has to do with what amounts are sent, it doesn't appear that the amount of ether sent is arbitrary.

Several of the addresses appear to have gotten funding from the address that is being sent the transactions as well, days ago.

It is too time consuming and tedious for me to continue, but I do not believe this to be an attack. I believe it to be some type of test or network research. It is obviously a bot (or more than one) involved, and many of these addresses have had transactions involving token contracts (SALT appears to be common, as well as this address  https:--etherscan.io-address-0xb7bd981cac9f087177fe90fc4d6439d3f2782061 which is the destination of the calls to the SALT contract to send SALT to).

Additionally, the funding for all of this appears to come from shapeshift, which leads me to believe that whoever is doing this has holdings in something else and is using shapeshift to mix the source.

The second address OP has in their edit seems to be linked to golem and this address https:--etherscan.io-address-0x7fe2b88f2e4858de375832fbf54ac7cf1a78ca51 in a similar manner that the above one is linked to SALT. It appears though that its transactions are not arbitrary amounts, but based on some metric or conversion as well. So I would guess that a different bot is controlling these transactions, or some different desired outcome.

I hope someone else will add to what I've noticed.       ",2018-01-14 13:45:00

At that point it started spamming 0 eth transactions until Jan 14 05:30 https:--etherscan.io-tx-0x99dce8081049b0956c9fab39ceda9029785566c30b93839e669e12c6964e7469

I don't think this was a malicious thing, it looks more like the program was doing a lot of transfers and averaging 10-20 transfers per hour, then something broke (api change?) and the program went down. When the program came back up, either the program malfunctioned or the api it was calling changed. The program was trying to transfer ETH but failing for some reason and it was trying to do that repeatedly and spamming the network with far more transactions than it normally does because the eth was never removed from it's wallet.

It looks like some program is holding tokens in a unique contract for an account, then it transfers ETH in as gas to transfer the tokens out, then it withdraws whatever tokens are remaining.

- How do you go about actually selling your ETH? My friend told me to set up an account with local ethereum; is this reliable or are there better methods?

- Is Jaxx a suitable wallet? Currently using Coinbase since I live in Canada and being able to store various cryptos seemed useful.

- Are there any other general tips or concepts I should study up on for cryptocurrency? I've been doing research lately and have been able to slightly wrap my head around the concept of cryptocurrency and how it works but still trying to find out how to properly trade and manage your crypto. Currently studying up on the details of Ethereum, but the general idea of ""smart contracts"" is what sold me on investing in this over Bitcoin.

- What should I be focusing on or paying attention to when it comes to the pricing of ETH? Are there other coins in which you would recommend to diversify into? (If so, how is this done cause I only know of Coinbase thus far.)

> The **entire blockchain for both systems is determined by fewer than 20 mining entities** [4]. While traditional Byzantine quorum systems operate in a different model than Bitcoin and Ethereum, a Byzantine quorum system with 20 nodes would be more decentralized than Bitcoin or Ethereum with significantly fewer resource costs. Of course, the design of a quorum protocol that provides open participation, while fairly selecting 20 nodes to sequence transactions, is non-trivial.

However, a majority of those people do not believe in cryptocurrency in general. This is not because it is made from blockchain, but because most cryptocurrencies have ridiculously high market caps and levels of investment with very little to back it. Most people, when investing in crypto, are looking at the potential of the technology in the future. For groundbreaking technology companies that have great ideas, but lack a sizable market, the amount of money invested into them is usually only on the scale of a few millions. But now crypto is insanely overvalued. Many coins that are solving real world problems in the same way a traditional company would have market caps nearing a billion or more. This is insane when looked at from a traditional perspective in terms of value. The technology might be amazing, but the valuations it has are crazy for where these cryptos are currently. 

I wouldn't say cryptos that are actually aiming to function as a currency in some way are necessarily overvalued though, since currencies (what monero or bitcoin aim to be) and solving problems (ex ripple) are completely different.

It's one thing to be skeptical of crypto and another to be skeptical of blockchain, but I have not met anyone who is skeptical of the benefits of blockchain technology.",2018-01-19 12:22:00

I see the same with crypto. It isnt easy now. Bitcoin is like the invention of the internet. Coinbase is like geocities. Not even AOL yet.

Stoll also raised questions about the influence of the Internet on future society, and whether it would be beneficial. He made various predictions in the article, e.g., about e-commerce (calling it nonviable due to a lack of personal contact and secure online funds transfers) and the future of printed news publications (""no online database will replace your daily newspaper""). When the article resurfaced on Boing Boing in 2010, Stoll left a self-deprecating comment: ""Of my many mistakes, flubs, and howlers, few have been as public as my 1995 howler ...

>*Computers are big in hobby fashion. Some people feel really stupid, because they do not have such a smart box at home. No cause for concern! Most of the hastily purchased ""home computers"" are soon dying in a corner anyway. Or at best be used for computer games that are boring in the long run.

>Still, a computer can do a lot. For example, keep the appointment calendar or create an address directory. The only question is: why? All this can also be written by hand. The computer games are ultimately always the same and have the disadvantage that you sit alone while playing. As a chess partner, however, the computer is ""unbeatable"".

>A computer is an expensive hobby. One should think well before purchasing, if he really will become the hobby of the future for one.*

There are some more statements. At the time, there was a TV report on CD-ROM, which concluded that CD-ROM would not prevail.

Or in 2013, german chancellor Angela Merkel claimed that the Internet was new territory for all. In 2013! Not 1993 :)

1,dswzh0j,"> She at one stage was quoted in a newspaper saying that the Internet was a fad and that it would pass and soon be over, a statement for which she has often been ridiculed.

The Swedish Communication Minister, Ines Uusmann, said in 1996 that:

> Internet is just a fad

Source: https:--en.wikipedia.org-wiki-Ines_Uusmann

She was paraphrased, however, and really said:

> ""I dare not have a definite opinion, but I do not think people will want to spend as much time as it actually takes to surf the web. [...] Surfing the web takes a lot of time. What's good for? [...] Maybe it's something that has grown up now. Everyone is talking about the internet, but maybe it's transient and then the focus will be more specified. ""

Source: https:--sv.wikipedia.org-wiki-Ines_Uusmann

But still, she admitted years later that she actually underestimated the use of the Internet - to be honest, I think a lot of people did then. Just like it is pretty impossible to actually comprehend the future of Crypto - will it be widespread like a new web as some speak about or just a passing fad? I think it has a role to play for sure (i wouldn't bet on it otherwise) but only time will tell the scale of it.

Comparing it to the early days of the internet, thousands of people are working in the crypto-space, as did in the internet era. There were also huge cash flows into it. We also saw lots of startups and just by utilizing the web or putting .com in your name, gave a boost to your earnings or stock price. 

There's no denying that you see many similarities, what it really takes is a belief in the future of crypto, hard-working people willing to spend their time and money in the space and continued growth of technology. 

We will likely see many crashes until then, coins to come and go, startups to rise and fall, but ultimately, we will see crypto take its rightful place as technology that is here to stay (I'm still waiting for people to understand its usage so I can travel the world without having to pay ridiculous fees for transactions and spread).",2018-01-19 20:16:00

The hook I see that is _maybe_ possible is some sort of identity angle associated with lowering fees from reputation.  That IS an interesting idea, although I'm not clear what blockchain does for that other than potentially enshrining non-human-judgment (trustless) into the equation, but even that seems difficult to deal with in the real world.

If blockchain is key here, then _how_.  Much like the payment option, simply having lower fees isn't sufficient and at best your business can only compete marginally better by having lower costs to deal with credit card fraud and lower transactions costs, at least as I see it.

In early 1995 we pitched Reed Elsevier. They allowed us to do a conference web site, but brought the question of bringing their publications on-line or even a corporate web site was brought up at a board meeting. 

We were told by our contact that the consensus on the board was that Why would people want to look up publications on the internet. 

Granted I think this was before or around the time that netscape with SSL was released. There were no payment gateways. People would have to print out the publications as no one would want to read anything on a 640x480 VGA screen. (Basically too early for that market)

I did start working on tourist web sites and later that year moved to the British Virgin Islands, literally the same week they got dial up internet service.

Within a month about 10% of the population had signed up for internet, primarily because phone-fax calls to the US were $3-m so email solved a real need. 

I was able to sell websites to about 20-30 hotels-restaurants etc. over the next couple of months. This was because these businesses had a real need of marketing themselves to affluent tourists from the US.

I think the real moral of the story is that with Ethereum we need to attack the areas where we can already solve problems and continue to work on the technologies that other businesses need - such as payment speed (state channels), identity (uPort), geo (foam.space) etc.",2018-01-20 22:45:00

Yeah kinda like how you just posted it for everyone to see?

It's what you should NEVER give to anyone, let alone post on a public article for the world to see. It looks like the writer's was actually using that address too. What the hell was he thinking? Wow...

And that's not even the big problem here, now everyone who reads that article is gonna think that it's OK to post your private keys out in the open. Do NOT do this, you WILL lose all your funds.

The author successfully starts with an intro to crypto, intro to block chain, history of internet protocols, then delves into centralization not from a government perspective, but private industry. He explores identity being owned by companies like Facebook and google, and once respected and valued media becoming a commodity being peddled for your attention and ergo, revenue.

Then he explores how blockchain can be used to decentralize your identity, to create a sort of portable social network. He dives into something I¨¹ve been hearing about and looking in to recently, IPFS, a distributed, decentralized, internet file system.

The article is really about the internet¨¹s open source, decentralized roots, and how blockchain and tech based on top of it could usher in a new era of internet. The only thing that wasn¨¹t covered was the new concepts of p2p, community internet that seem to be born from the whole net neutrality debate in the US. Think the last season of Silicon Valley.

The future is exciting. Maybe, 10 years from now, instead of building an app on Amazons cloud infrastructure, it¨¹ll be built on IPFS-Ethereum, and run on a literal ¨¹public cloud.¨¹ ",2018-01-22 16:19:00

0,dt3px3v,"It seems like Bitcoin is getting its head out of the clouds. According to coinmarketcap, its price lost a lot during last month. Capitalization exponential growth turns out to be not quite coherent with the Bitcoin degree of integration into the real life. Undoubtedly, this fact is considered to be one of distinguishing peculiarities of so-called bubble. According to the majority of analytical forecasts, Bitcoin is to fall three times in 2018-2019, what thus will approximate its capitalization value to a more reasonable one.

Possible reasons of Bitcoins decline can be accumulated risks, connected with Bitcoin data storage difficulties in some systems as well as with increase in time and cost of its transactions. Investing in Bitcoin can rightly be called extreme, and cryptocurrency exchange infrastructure at first sight is struggling with recently established overload. From the other hand, such high volatility is generally very representative for cryptocurrency market, where the significant role is given to political game of main holders.

In addition to the ongoing informational attack towards Bitcoin in terms of Ministry of Finance of Japan and Monetary Authority of Singapore statements concerning its unreliability, there were other events contributing to the fall. Emil Oldenburg, co-founder of Bitcoin.com, declared that Bitcoin has no perspecrspective as a trading currency and sold his holdings. Getting rid of Bitcoin, agents usually invest in its direct rivals, such as BCH. 
Simultaneously with Bitcoin decline, one can see rapid growth of most altcoins¨¹ rates. Index of dominance has dropped to approximately 50%. More technologically and informatively loaded, altcoins definitely can have a higher potential. What they really lack is mass accessibility. In order to become a mass instrument, altcoin is to provide an easier and clearer way of its generation.

VICoin is based on Ethereum technological platform, which has time and again updated its positions in TOP-10 cryptocurrencies recently, what emphasizes transparent advantages of the system. Moreover, with ¨¹digging¨¹ (as compared to ¨¹mining¨¹) being more apprehensible and easier to manage, Virtonomic$ turns VICoin into a massively available alternative cryptocurrency. Analyzing and forecasting cryptocurrency market motion, Virtonomic$ is to meet the basic needs of participants along with highest possible technological standards.

21,dt5u3qh,"Good article although I have to disagree with the paragraph on rising transaction fees.

The author states:
>A multifold increase in a coin¨¹s price, implies a multifold increase in transaction fees when denominating in fiat currency.

This isn't true, especially in the case of Ethereum. First of ceteris paribus (especially concerning transaction pool size), the market for gas is determined by the demand users have for it and the supply the miners are willing to provide. If users are willing to pay $0.05 for a transfer and then see the price of Ether rise dramatically then the rational action would be to reduce the gas price until the transaction fee is $0.05 again. 

There may well be a market lag in gas prices but this doesn't mean rising Ether prices imply rising transaction fees, a rising price implies decreasing gas prices.",2018-01-24 19:46:00

1,dt656wl,"I think it might be R-Chain, with Lucius (Greg) Meredith as the chief system architect of the project. He's been working on Kasper and there's even a video of him video chatting with Vitalik about sharding. He also has a lot of patents to his name and he's a mathematician who developed a new sort of field in mathematics.

R-Chain might just be the blockchain that solves the scallabilty problem, because it's claimed to be 'correct by construction', meaning, it learned from the mistakes of the previous blockchain and implements a better way of building a system from the start. It implements the use of rholang as the system coding language.

From the official website: '

""To become a blockchain solution with industrial-scale utility, RChain must provide content delivery at the scale of Facebook and support transactions at the speed of Visa.

After due diligence on the current state of many blockchain projects, after deep collaboration with Ethereum developers, and after understanding their respective roadmaps, we concluded that the current and near-term Blockchain architectures cannot meet these requirements.

In mid-2016, we resolved to build a better blockchain architecture.""

Disclaimer: I'm a holder of the Rchain token and I believe in the project.

12,dt6nvj7,"This sparks an interesting idea. There has been discussion about how regular companies that issue stocks are terrible since it encourages companies to pay more attention to quarterly profits than paying attention to long-term goals that might not be achieved for years, decades, or even generations. 

The health care market in the US also has an ""enrollment"" period where you can sign up for plans unless there is some kind of qualifying event like getting a new job, having a kid, getting married, etc. 

Tokens that have restricted usage during lock-up periods could be useful. 

I know one problem with dividend distribution to token holders is that some people will receive dividends and then move their tokens to another address in an effort to receive dividends again. If a token could be locked from movement for a 2 hours period every Monday at midnight UTC, it would allow for safer dividend payments to addresses that hold tokens. 

Another fun time-based calculation would be locking or unlocking tokens for differing amounts of time based on how many tokens were being held in the current wallet. More than 1000 tokens? Can't move the tokens until the average age of the tokens in the wallet is 60 days. More than 10,000 tokens? Can't move the tokens until the average age of the tokens in the wallet is 90 days. etc. This would be a great bit of code for ICO's to make it so Whale investors would have to commit to long-term investment. 

Many stocks also only trade during certain hours (the hours the exchange is open) so something like that could be replicated... Trading is only between 7am and 4pm EST, Monday to Friday.

There might be a way to do a coupon token too... A whitelisted address (the minting address) could send tokens anytime they want, but the receiving addresses can't move them until a certain date (Black Friday?) or during a certain time period (Coupon is good from June 1st to Aug 1st). Could be good to sell tickets for pre-sell items. ($5 for a token that can be redeemed on a certain day to purchase a phone or a miner or something, but can't be transferred to another person, and the contract could limit the number of tokens a single address can have)

Nice idea to put in time-based limitations on functions. It opens up some fun possibilities!",2018-01-25 04:49:00

So many other crypto currencies are based in Bitcoin forks, Ponzi schemes, vaporware, or cheap knockoffs. Not Wednesday Coin. Wednesday Coin is completely absurd. It's a low-res generic coin, and an arbitrary method of celebrating Wednesday. The first person to ever receive Wednesday Coin did not do so out of recognition. The first person to ever receive Wednesday Coin did not do so because a pre-existing smart contract format. The first person to ever receive Wednesday Coin received a coin literally pulled from the ether by sheer human creativity and willpower. Wednesday Coin is evidence that humans can stare into the meaningless void of eternity and force their own meaning onto to it. I will always HODL Wednesday Coin, my dudes!

A few questions: I've read in your whitepaper that you didn't use ETH smart contract because you were afraid you can't update them later so you launched a special blockchain for CryptoCribs. 
  
Is this blockchain public or private? 
  
IMO there a way to put on the blockchain only the core functions of your dApp and to keep the libraries offline where you can update them more easily (like CryptoKitties does). And of course, you can always kill a contract and create a new one in case you require a major update. Why didn't you go with that? ",2018-01-27 17:13:00

28,dtqmcdv,"Some constructive advice:

If you want to make it responsive quickly, take a look into Bootstrap. It's a CSS framework that will allow you to quickly make a site responsive. It's pretty simple to figure out enough with Bootstrap to make your page responsive it pretty much does it for you to a certain degree. You can even download pre-made Bootstrap themes to help if you aren't that strong with CSS. But if you want to learn, then using a pre-made layout won't do much for you knowledge wise. You could of course use Flexbox as well depending on how comfortable you are with CSS. Also, you need to learn to use Media Queries. They are very important to responsive design. There is not a way around learning this if you wanna make websites. Sure those CSS frameworks will do most of the heavy lifting, but sometimes certain elements might need to be hidden at a certain viewport width, shrunk down, rearranged. expanded etc etc, and that's where your media queries will do their magic. 

For design, I always take a look through Pinterest at the infinite web design examples for inspiration. You can get a good idea of what the current design trends are, and honestly, you can get a really good feel for what's generally accepted as ""good design"". You can also look for color palettes in the same manner. If you're aiming to build websites, I'd recommend learning how to mock up a wireframe. There are countless tools out there for this, Sketch is the one that comes to my mind.  You could also use plain ole Photoshop. If you aren't comfortable with Photoshop or another wireframe tool, take some time to watch a few YouTube videos to get the gist of whatever program you wanna use. I can tell you that once I started making wireframes, everything became a lot easier. You finalize the design before any of your markup and styles are written. That way you can clearly plan how you will write everything. 

Also, don't take any negative comments to heart. It's your first website,  no? Most people don't understand how difficult it is to learn to make a website. Most are accustomed to a drag and drop website maker (like Shopify or Wix) to get the job done. It's very hard to not only make something look good but to also have to code the website as well. Do you plan on being a beginner forever? If the answer is no then don't take the opinions of others to heart. You won't always be making websites like this. You'll grow and progress overtime. Your first website, although rough, is a good attempt. It's got a use case, and it's better than some other first attempts I've seen. Take the negative feedback and use it as a motivator to make something better.

This is a lie: https:--twitter.com-mycrypto-status-961769008436400128

This is a sad attempt at justifying the theft of the MEW Twitter account: https:--twitter.com-mycrypto-status-961885331183185924

Imagine the person who runs the Binance Twitter account starting a new exchange called MyCryptoExchange, then renaming the Twitter account and telling everyone ""Binance still exists, but we're now MyCryptoExchange.""

This is exactly what happened here.

How can we ever trust an individual that backstabs their business partners (an established and well-respected brand) and tries to fool the crypto community by passing it off as a rebrand or fork? She is truly deluded if she thought this shit would fly.

We already have too much shitty drama in crypto, the last thing we need is people with little integrity running key components like a wallet service where trust is everything. I'm sure I won't be the only one boycotting MyCrypto and every one of their partners.

36,dtzayq9,"So the reality here is that the MEW twitter handle wasn't hijacked--it was bought and paid for...seeing as that is the only ""valuable"" non-open-source property available.

tl;dr:

-u-insomniasexx cuts a back-door deal with some VC dudes to rebrand the MEW twitter account and all followers.

-u-khvnuke has no idea about any of this.

-u-insomniasexx claims she took it because it was always her personal account; she raised the followers and that's that.

But by looking at the facts it seems that -u-insomniasexx saw the ability to make a great deal of profit off of MEW very quickly, but seeing as it is an open-source project, the only thing worth any real dinero is the twitter account...and that is what she took. Now she tries to justify it.

Taylor & others have played a large role in education and community outreach, which I'm assuming you were not a big part of.  Is this a correct assumption?  Will this be something you and the new team will also focus on?

---

Regarding the Twitter situation - It's clear to me that the community around that account was developed by Taylor.  Letting the MyCrypto team take it over would probably be the path of least resistance since listeners will continue to get the info from the same source.

However, the Twitter was owned by MyEtherWallet, and that's your IP now.  The decision to split should've accounted for the fact that you now need to rebuild the community that the original product has.

I think Taylor and the MyCrypto team are perfectly capable of rebuilding their Twitter presence, and it was a mistake to ""steal"" that account & community.  **However**, if they release the account back to MyEtherWallet, it would be best to let the followers know that it is now being managed by somebody else.",2018-02-10 05:32:00

Quite honestly, not shedding light on what happened and then following it up with the odd transitioning of the twitter account, and you apparently losing the entirety of your MEW team doesn't clarify much for anyone. What team members were lost and how much access do they have to anything legacy to MEW?

The [gist](https:--www.reddit.com-r-ethereum-comments-7wgnds-official_myetherwallet_statement-du09upn-) seems to be that they had a disagreement, and kvhnuke wanted to split ways by ~~selling his stake~~buying Taylor's stake (edit: others have pointed out that the agreement was to buy out Taylor's [and possibly the third investor's] stake) in the company (MyEtherWallet, LLC).  However, he also wanted access to MyEtherWallet's financials, of which Taylor had sole access; under law, she's apparently required to provide him access should he request it.  Instead, she provided him with a fucking google doc (see exhibit 1).  Despite repeated attempts, she still has not provided access to those financials.

Seems like she was trying to keep something hidden from him, potentially something that might make him reconsider the agreement to sell his stake in MyEtherWallet, LLC for $1M.

On -u-kvhnuke , on -u-insomniasexx

They are programmers. Great programmers. Awesome programmers. Who have built code like no one else could or has done.

The Ethereum community has grown and built upon their services, using their services, and owes **a lot** of its success to these 2 great coders.

But as good as they are at being coders, the worse they are at being business people I'm guessing. And that's where it has probably gone wrong?


So please, I want to implore everyone here, to not be harsh on them. 

Business stuff, legal stuff, financial stuff, **is not** what these great persons signed up for. We can only speculate, but whatever has gone wrong, is between these two people and nobody elses business.

I also hope that whatever has gone wrong in the relation between them, can and will be fixed.

For now, I hope everyone just focusses on the positive things they have done for us, rather than judging any of them.

If you want to use MEW, or MyCrypto.com please do so. 

If you are afraid and don't trust it, please use another service for the time being until the air clears up.

>Q: What happened with MyEtherWallets Twitter handle?
A: The team working at MyCrypto is the same team that has managed MyEtherWallets Twitter handle for the past three years. The content that has been shared on @MyEtherWallet since 2015 is the thinking of the team that now makes up MyCrypto.

>The Twitter followership plays an important role as a security beacon and relayer of important information during community-emergency-type events. With this in mind, the operators of the account made the decision to keep the Twitter followership under the control of those who have the track record of executing its duties faithfully and in line with the needs of the community.

>We wish marketing and security were not so intertwined, and MyCrypto in no way intends to steal the fruits of MyEtherWallets promotional efforts. We encourage any followers to follow both companies as this transition manifests (you can still follow MyEtherWallets handle at @myetherwallet). We hope the community appreciates the difficulty in balancing these two important intereterests.

>We have worked with Twitter to follow all procedures and policies, including becoming a verified user. We apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this has caused the community. To clarify further, the verification check-mark did not migrate with the username. As soon as the Twitter username was changed, verification was lost. We worked directly with Twitter to get @MyCrypto verified shortly thereafter. Had we not fully complied with Twitter¨¹s verification process to establish that we are a legitimate, bonafide account, we would not have received the verification check-mark.""

36,du1mah8,"I am in both the Ethereum and OMG communities. In my view, OMG is one of the most promising projects in crypto.

- It has a clear value proposition: faster, cheaper payments. What they are building appears to have clear advantages over existing solutions in point-of-sale payments, mobile payments, and remittances.

- Omise, the parent company, has a live payment network. My understanding is that Omisego will become a more efficient back-end and enable more use cases (e.g. decentralized exchange). Omise already has relationships with clients and has a proven track record bringing products to market.

- OMG is investing less in marketing and hype than other projects. They are flying under the radar. I think this is part of why they are undervalued compared to, say, XLM or XRP.

- Conversely, OMG appears to be investing more time, money, and energy into actually building their product. I like this attitude.

- Strong team and many high-profile supporters, advisors, etc. These are people who have reputations to lose and that makes me think that wouldn't back something that is weak.

To address the questions:

> Does it play a long term role in the scaling of Ethereum?

I think OMG is going to be a test case for Plasma. I think the lessons learned will be important for Ethereum. Successful deployment on the OMG network will be a huge boost to Ethereum's prospects.

> Will it assume a large part of the simple value payments use case from the Ethereum blockchain?

My understanding is that OMG's project is limited in geographical scope to Southeast Asia at the moment. So implementation of point-of-sale payments, interconnections with existing infrastructure (e.g. ATMs, banking), and marketing will be focused on that region. I don't think OMG will be widely used for payments globally in the short term future, although I'm almost certain they want to scale to that ultimately. So I don't think OMG will take over the simple payments use case from Ethereum globally in the short term future.

",2018-02-14 23:38:00
49,du8jweo,"This release includes some usability and security improvements and a further evolution of the SMT component. The ``var`` keyword has been deprecated for security reasons.

Significant steps were made in writing optimisation stages for the intermediate language, which will be used by the new ABI encoder to produce highly optimised output. The main goal is to have a resulting bytecode size similar to the old ABI encoder, while having more runtime checks for a stricter decoding process. This is not yet enabled in this release.

**Features:**

 * Code Generator: Prevent non-view functions in libraries from being called
   directly (as opposed to via delegatecall).
 * Commandline interface: Support strict mode of assembly (disallowing jumps,
   instructional opcodes, etc) with the ``--strict-assembly`` switch.
 * Inline Assembly: Issue warning for using jump labels (already existed for jump instructions).
 * Inline Assembly: Support some restricted tokens (return, byte, address) as identifiers in Iulia mode.
 * Optimiser: Replace ``x % 2**i`` by ``x & (2**i-1)``.
 * Resolver: Continue resolving references after the first error.
 * Resolver: Suggest alternative identifiers if a given identifier is not found.
 * SMT Checker: Take if-else branch conditions into account in the SMT encoding of the program
   variables.
 * Syntax Checker: Deprecate the ``var`` keyword (and mark it an error as experimental 0.5.0 feature).
 * Type Checker: Allow `this.f.selector` to be a pure expression.
 * Type Checker: Issue warning for using ``public`` visibility for interface functions.
 * Type Checker: Limit the number of warnings raised for creating abstract contracts.

**Bugfixes:**

 * Error Output: Truncate huge number literals in the middle to avoid output blow-up.
 * Parser: Disallow event declarations with no parameter list.
 * Standard JSON: Populate the ``sourceLocation`` field in the error list.
 * Standard JSON: Properly support contract and library file names containing a colon (such as URLs).
 * Type Checker: Suggest the experimental ABI encoder if using ``struct``s as function parameters
   (instead of an internal compiler error).
 * Type Checker: Improve error message for wrong struct initialization.

Why does creating a struct (even if I¨¹m storage) overwrite other data in storage. Shouldn¨¹t the struct just be appended to the end of the contracts current storage (seeing as the storage boils down to a map it¨¹s not like they ran out of addresses)?  And the link you gave that goes to the solidity guide (which I¨¹ve read up and done countless times) doesn¨¹t say much about this vulnerability.

In my contract work I try to stay away from structs due to how ambiguous the docs are and so I would love to hear from you since you seem to get it more than I do. Also, the only place I use structs currently is within maps with the struct as the data, or as data within an array I push to.

It seems kind of similar to Bancor's smart tokens and relay tokens, which are smart contracts that convert between tokens. Basically the contract holds one token and accepts that token to issue another, and accepts (and destroys) the issued token in exchange for the one held. Liquidity without having to match with a counterparty. Tie two of those together and you've got a relay token for exchangeless transacting between tokens. I read the whitepaper a while back and it seemed interesting, but going to their site (which looks just like an exchange) and seeing you don't even have to login to trade between tokens was one of those ""Oh, cool!"" moments that the crypto space continualy provides.

We're 1 of 3 states that they refused to operate in.  This will be fixed once the bills pass.  All 5 are flying through the process and it's expected all should be passed in the next week. 

The real goal is to bring miners and businesses to Wyoming.  Our dry cold climate is perfect for mining operations, Microsoft has a data center here for that reason.  Wyoming created LLCs and they outbumber citizens 2-1 nearly.   Being we have no state tax, a lot of revenue we generate is through the fees of incorporating in Wyoming among others.  We're really looking to try and take advantage of the Crypto boom and I love it.

So, for the cost of 2 expensive Tx and 2 cheap Tx, you can make several cheap Tx instead of the same number of expensive Tx. 

I guess Tx costs between cryptocurrencies will be averaged over time, then, all while profiting the miners and the cryptocurrency value from the cryptocurrency with the cheapest Tx costs. It's great! ",2018-02-23 15:30:00

4,duyq3z7,">JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations.

>New competitors have emerged. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payment processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. **Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payment processing and other services could be disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require no intermediation**. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies.

>Ongoing or increased competition may put downward pressure on prices and fees for JPMorgan Chase¨¹s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share. This competition may be on the basis of, among other factors, quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase¨¹s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions or underperformance, could affect JPMorgan Chase¨¹s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase¨¹s revenues. Increased competition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive.

20,duyv19r,"Same clickbait headline as was posted about Bank of America and Bitcoin the other day. I'm not even going to bother to click the link and just say someone just stumbled across their annual report to investors, and saw the entry about crypto.

The mention about it isn't there because they see it as a real risk, it's their because corporate lawyers put it in there to cover the boards asses just in case. That way, if they do tank one day because they can't understand crypto and get hit with shareholder lawsuits, they can point to their annual report and say ""look! we told you this!""

Big banks transact in any number of currencies, and make their money on the services they layer on top of that. I'm don't think adding a new (crypto) currency to the lot will be a major stumbling point, but they have to put it in there just to make everyone happy.

Like it or not, banks will likely be able to muscle into the crypto game with the same exact business plan that they offer to regular currency holders.

""Think its too risk holding your balance yourself? We'll hold it for you! And we've got plenty of other assets (and insurance!) to cover losses if they do occur. Not only that, but we'll pay you interest for letting us hold your coins...""

""You want to spend your crypto? Sign into our portal, enter the information for your payee, and your transaction will be on its way! Not near a computer? Use our debit card that automatically converts funds on the fly.""

""Want to buy a house but don't want to take a huge tax hit from selling your crypto? We'll give you a mortgage for 3%, which will be fully collateralized by the ether in your account. Pay tax-deductible interest, and avoid the capital gains hit"" (unless the tax change ended the mortgage interest deduction, i'm not even sure).

And if the crypto world gravitates to the hub and spoke idea that the Lightning folks are pushing, who better to capitalize the payment hubs, and conduct KYC, etc?

Point is, Crypto's definitely are a game change for central banks and monetary policy, but commercial banks will be just as happy to layer on the same services they offer to crypto owners, and will be happy to roll out additional services too.

The astute eyed people who are finding mentions of Bitcoin and Crypto in annual reports aren't finding them because the C-Suite is running around in a panic, they're there because lawyers are putting in those entries, just in case the everyone else drops the ball completely, not because they expect them to.",2018-03-01 00:59:00

When a crypto currency shows any sign of gaining traction, big money buys it up, farms it, etc, and then makes profit off everyone else's backs by manipulating the cost of the currency.
 
... the problem with crypto currencies, you are also avoiding the regulation that exists with actual currency that kinda helps keep big money (somewhat) in check.

4. The quote at the bottom, ""theres nothing bitcoin can do that ethereum cant"".. well, except scale to millions-billions of users. That quote must be about 3 years old. Again, misinformation.

Conferences are fun and useful when it comes to connecting people. The thing is... I don't believe you can innovate in a conference. You talk, you meet, you see new ideas but that's pretty much all you can gain. It would be extremely more useful to have a community active on writing and patching than presenting ICOs at a conference. There are a bunch of guys that I respect a lot and most of them belong to the ethereum foundation. The rest is ICO CEOs and stuff. Instead of joining conferences (that focus more on money than the technology itself) it's more useful to write docs and help people get involved. For example, the documentation for securying smart contracts is almost non existing. Conferences are cool but building and educating is more important. If you prefer to attend a conference that more than 50% of the speakers come from ICOs good for you. I will stick to the ethereum foundation speakers.

With the recent SEC decision that ICOs are to be considered securities, I imagine we will see a big reduction in the number of ICOs occuring (however the ICOs we will see will be regulated which is good for protecting us individual investors from the likes of Bitconnect etc).

As Ethereum is the largest platform for ICOs atm - what do you reckon the impacts of the SEC-regulation of ICOs in general will be on it? We'll certainly see fewer ICOs on the platform, but maybe quality over quantity is good in the long run?

If the SEC is successful in establishing the precedent that ICO's are illegal securities, then the wild west days of token sales will be over, and Ethereum's current number one use case will become seriously restricted. That would likely usher in a multi-year bear market similar to Bitcoin post 2013.

On the bright side, Ethereum's long-term success may actually benefit from such a ruling. If the US comes up with a regulatory framework that permits ICO's to go through SEC registration without being overly burdensome, then that's akin to the US endorsing ICO's as legitimate securities, which is necessary for ETH's adoption by institutional investors.

387,dvisplw,"Ethereum uses proof-of-work, which is supposed to be decentralized enough to make it impractical for one player to break the system. Satoshi imagined a ""long tail"" effect where although there may be some big players, they were outweighed by a large number of small ones.

This has already failed on its own terms; Mining power has professionalized and rationalized itself into a small number of players, and even if it didn't the economic incentives lead the small players to pool together into big players.

The reason we're not all already writing off the whole experiment as a failure (apart from because the fact that we hold bags and it's making us rich that nobody has noticed) is because these security flaws haven't really been exploited; The miners haven't really tried to tinker with the ledger, and they also haven't really done things that look like they're in their rational economic interests like forming cartels to kill off competitors. In that sense the meta-incentives behind the system seem fairly robust, but it's not at all clear that it would hold up under pressure, whether in the form of governments attacking the system or mining companies transitioning from their current generation of gentleman anarchists to the psychopaths with MBAs who run normal businesses.

In theory Ethereum has some changes in the pipeline to help with the most obviously broken parts of Satoshi's design; For example, Casper is designed to deal with cartels, which are one of the main gaping flaws in most existing PoW and PoS systems.

15,dvitglt,"I want to start with a disclaimer that I own ADA, which is created by IOHK, who's CEO is Charles Hoskinson (one of the co-founders of Ethereum). So my scenario is mostly based from this perspective.

I see Ethereum as a pioneer when it comes to a platform for smart contracts. However the code doesn't separate the accounting from computation which as seen with the DAO hack is something that can be very damaging when it goes wrong.

This increases technical debt and makes it harder to update the code, since you have to be incredibly careful when your code is the backbone of a network worth $70B~. At the start of a project an engineering approach as opposed to a scientific one will let you implement good changes quickly, but as code complexity increases your ability to improve the system while being sure you're not breaking it slows down.

If you have a scientific approach it might take a long time to get the foundation right, and any improvements will be slower but they are more guaranteed to be secure. However if Ethereum can somehow refactor the code in the future (same functionality but more cleanly written), this might alleviate this concern quite a bit.

TL;DR: I see code complexity as a factor since it can slow down development and increases the likelihood of bugs being introduced to the system.",2018-03-11 18:28:00

The more plausible scenario is where an alternative coin with similar features as Ethereum, is able to scale massively (perhaps at the cost of centralization), before Ethereum can do so, leading to a cascade of Dapps moving to said platforms, followed by users, hype, etc.. Though even this is not a given. There are a number of coins with superior scaling properties than say Bitcoin, yet transaction volume is close to zero. I think you could also make the case that there will be a number of successful blockchains, even with similar features.

Ok so I'm bullish but I'l chime in with my FUD list of doom! :)

[Technical risks]

CASPER POS is challenging and not 100% certain it will work.
Scaling & sharding is challenging and not 100% certain it will work.
Maybe despite being batshit crazy Paul Sztorc could be right that oracles are impossible
Possible long term security holes of fundamental flaws might be discovered
[Resource & cashflow risk]

Foundation has limited funds.
Key developers could be poached.
Still not seeing evidence of significant VC investment.
[Competition risks]

R3 may win financial market
Hyperledger may win IOT market
Ripple could win international settlement & remittances market.
Some anon coin may win the darknet market
Could have a million ethereum alt coins indeed consensy could themselves fork Ethereum
Bitcoin might finally sort out their politics
Rootstock & counterparty
Some new unknown coin could be a better ethereum than ethereum.
[Regulatory risks]

Goverments could clamp down on crypto exchanges
Goverments could require permissioned system or back a rival system
Goverments could clamp down on IPO or crowd shares
Goverments could clamp down on issuance of assets or create more onerous KYC requirements
[Reputational risks]

If Kraken or Polonex is the new Mt Gox
If some scam or pyramid scheme gives Dapps a bad name
If a significant number of wallets are hacked
If Ethereum community becomes as toxic as the bitcoin community
[Barriers to adoption]

It is hard to communicate what Ethereum is
Press insist on using the term 'blockchain' or 'bitcoin'
Ethereum PR sucks.
It is still hard for 'normal people' to buy Ether and securely store it.
There is not yet a killer app
Maybe nobody actually wants Dapps or even crypto currency they just want an investment opportunity
Even if there is a killer app the advantages of decentralisation are unclear
Maybe noone actually cares about decentralisation apart from nutjob bitcoiners and they only care about bitcoin
Still no major exchanges listing and hard to buy in directly from fiat
Major Chinese exchanges may never add Eth because they make all their money from mining BTC so don't want Eth to succeed.
[Risk Ethereum could succeed without Ether becoming really valuable]

Stable coins, gold & other currencies will be used for payment & wealth storage not Eth.
Eth will lose it's monopoly for buying gas
Because of competition & scaling transaction fees will fall to the cost of operation & capital.

In every peer to peer network you need a way to find who is in that network, in the case of Ethereum, its bootstrap nodes, if they were no longer supported, then no new miner would be able to find initial peers for them to connect to.

**2. ISP being malicious**

The whole network is run over centralised network infrastructure, should ISP's want, they could get a list of all peers on the network, and pick and choose which packets get delivered to those nodes. They could for example hijack the network by disabling all packets to nodes except for their own nodes and gain a 51% majority.

**3. Code distributors**

You need to download the source code from a centralised entity, These code distributors could say they are distributing a certain codebase but in fact inject malicious code

**4. Government**

Should the government ban cryptocurrencies, for example, due to many people losing money due to the unstable nature of cryptocurrency or big hacks-scams or the environmental impact or any combination of the above, it would then make it much more difficult to receive code from code distributors and all ISP's would terminate all packets being sent by or delivered by nodes.

**5. Lack of actual value**

Currently, all use cases on cryptocurrency can be achieved with traditional infrastructure & software methods at a much cheaper price, better performance and much lower environmental impact. The claim is that cryptocurrency is still young, but as time goes on if no actual new use case is created by cryptocurrency people will just lose interest, many of the current use cases could be fulfilled by a junior software developer very easily.

19,dvl5f1y,"Hi r-ethereum! We are very pleased with the excitement generated from our involvement in Sierra Leone. It is my job to interact with the community and coordinate with our team for answers.

####I am also pleased to announce that unbeknownst to you, the Ethereum network was utilized in this unprecedented event!

* [Here is the address](https:--etherscan.io-address-0xdF192F566166EFb9F0f01Ea9a4faA3B2699c0dbD) of the smart contract between Skipchain (our Blockchain) and Ethereum

* [Here is the address](https:--etherscan.io-tx-0xfe616d77af2a9044d3d44ff541e5da07650f4c896d624bb0a33fe66c5b18e5fb) of the last transaction on it registering the hash of the results. It represents the first hash involved in any presidential election in any context

If you click ""convert to ascii"" in the input data field, there would be the hash displayed. That's the same hash that our Javascript application for Sierra Leone is computing and comparing against.

>How does this work?

Our Sierra Leone website (shown in this post) contacts both Skipchain and Ethereum. On Skipchain, the raw data results are ""as-is"", so the client only has to go from the genesis block (the first Skipchain block) to the last one and read it.

For Ethereum, the raw results are put on a merkle tree and an aggregated value summarizing the whole result file is computed. We have a very simple smart contract that can ""save"" a value on Ethereum blockchain and the transaction giving this aggregated value to the smart contract is the second link.

We will not be revisiting this post to answer more questions but please do not hesitate to ask any questions you may have in r-agora. We have a process in place to ensure all of our answers are accurate and thoughtful.

I used the Mist wallet very briefly a few years ago but found it slow as well. My impression (as a professional computer technician) was that the software would need some beefy hardware to run it, possibly with server memory (with ECC). My suggestion is to do an assessment on your computer's hardware and if it is not at least younger than 2 years and using the equivalent of an Intel i5 processor with 16GB of RAM, then just drop Mist and pick up either Parity or just use MyEtherWallet.",2018-03-19 01:13:00

Not sure why, because there are apparently some people working on a new version

First they were waiting for Geth 1.8.0 with improved network features and better support for the light client. But some of these changes have since been included in the master branch and there is yet to be a new release.

They don't set deadlines and versions seem to have scope-creep. The open issues go down, but then suddenly new open issues are added. You can see milestones here: https:--github.com-ethereum-mist-milestones

   - since summer '17 you have to have an SSD to run a full node (with an HDD you'll never be able to catch up with the network - I never tried with an SSHD).

But another part of it is that, after downloading Mist, I couldn't do much of anything. It took forever to download, almost all of which was verifying the last node \(I think\). I couldn't figure out which long number was which. And also, part of it was figuring out enough places to store each of my long numbers without making them practically useless. But Mist was definitely a *huge* roadblock for me \-\- I had all of this momentum, and the fact that I had to wait forever just for it to start up, and once it does, it just hits me with that big wall of managing my identity properly.

As a side\-note: I feel like most people are going to struggle with identity management for ethereum. People don't even know how to use password managers right \-\- let alone keeping hardware keys, paper, and shit like that secure properly?

Fast forward to a month or two ago and I realized I had about $800 still on those wallets. I assumed I'd just reinstall mist and run with it. 

Wrong. I ended up having to use parity which was a bit of a mess as I had the bulk of my funds in a multisig wallet and I didn't find that very intuitive at first.

The EF will probably just ""merge"" Mist with parity, or link to parity from the web3 browser.

The questions you ask are spot-on, and have been asked before, and just like you, no one up to this point has got any official answer. More often than not, people who criticize the state of Ethereum are ignored and ridiculed, there is a group of people here who think ethereum is immune to criticism from outsiders.

I think the answers are partially to be found in the fact that parity more or less split from the EF. I think the EF has serious management issues, as you can read in my post from December:

https:--www.reddit.com-r-ethereum-comments-7mn93e-the_ethereum_foundation_itself_is_responsible_for-

Part of the problem seems to be that the people who are capable of developing good stuff for ethereum somehow don't want to work with the EF, though it is not entirely clear why that is the case.

Whatever the case, it is a shame that the EF is not able to properly invest it's hundreds of millions of dollars into a thriving developer community. To everyone who thinks this is not possible, just look at parity, mycrypto or myetherwallet and you see how a team with a handful of members can make a fundamental difference.

2,dw1k466,"I'd say next to this it is equally important (and related) to solve the increase in degenerative, metabolic diseases and conditions in western cultures which are related to a somewhat toxic culture that increasingly can not support life (think of factors like food, light, stress, sleep, environmental toxins, trauma), and to understand-reprogram the epigenetically imprinted inheritance associated with these problems with changes in the environment. 

One striking example of this kind of degenerative development is that we now have children that are already being born with tooth decay. 

The environmental factors that shape the human body are often overlooked in search for answers, because they cannot easily be translated into expensive 'treatments' and are often so highly effective that they are suppressed by the gate keepers (For example psychoactive drugs in the right context can permanently heal mental conditions).

The root cause of the problem is indeed aging, but only if one defines aging as a parameter that is a function of the metabolic state, not the genetic state. Thus aging and stress (in a biological sense) will be viewed as basically the same. 

Aging is a very simple process. As an organism stops getting the necessary energy to support ongoing function, it stops developing and degrades certain functions in order to save energy. The answer is increasing the biological energy in an organism.

In this way, nuclear mutations and mitochondrial mutations Dr. Aubrey de Grey talks about are the solidified result of energetic problems. Instead of copying DNA to save mitochondrial health, one would need to look at the metabolic factors that make mitochondria lose their health, and find protective factors that support the highly oxidative state. 

Otherwise we will probably arrive at a point where only the rich can have their life span extended with expensive treatments, while the masses will be left behind. We need to embrace a cultural paradigm shift as the very foundation of a healthy society, and while it is essential to manipulate certain biochemical pathways, this can be done primarily without expensive drugs and surgical engineering.",2018-03-21 19:14:00

The rise of quantum computing makes RSA cracking and several other forms of encryption in the near future. Classic computers use binary bits, which have a value of either zero or one. The strings of these zeros and ones are translated into data, but the nature of the bit means that only one calculation can be made at a time. However, with quantum computation, each quantum bit (called qubit) can be a zero and one at the same time.

And ETHlance. And Rados. And Bounties.network. And Sia. And StorJ. The fact some of them don't use ICO strategy to fund themselves is only a business model choice. 

Actually, making a token also is a big advantage in the near future, since it enables the possibility to easily make off-chain transactions. Cryptokitties will have more work to do to enable that, compared to models using tokens. 

You could have also said the same thing about start-ups during the early age of the Internet. Some of them succeeded in providing very useful services, though, just like right now with ICOs. Actually, ICOs are gearing up way more quickly than the Internet start-ups were. It all goes so fast it has already become impossible to follow the progress as a hobby (well, at least, I can't have the time as a hobby to follow it all anymore). 

In the end, the market decides if an ICO has a chance to be useful in the future or not. If people want to invest in them, there's no reason to forbid them. I don't know your position about that, I simply wanted people not to forget about that. 

That said, there seems to be a market need to develop trust between ICOs and their investors, to make sure ICOs which are truly involved into their promises can prove it and outcompete lazy ICOs. 

Fortunately, there are some ICOs trying to provide a service fulfilling a part of such market need. I don't recall the name right now, but I may look for it again if people are interested. It involved easily shown public accounting of fund distribution and achieved work linked to the fundings.

there's really little to no due diligence going on.   most analysts are 'buy side' analysts, only writing about companies and tokens that theyre promoting and are expecting to be rewarded with a % of the token sale funds.   even some of the independent analysts, of which there's a low number, are ill equipped to do any real analysis and in part stick to superficials like browsing the company's web site and the team bios.  not a bad start but it needs to go much deeper.

loads of independent reviewers are writing pieces with commissions or bounties etc.  I think anyone who has been paid to write a flattering review should be severely discounted.  quite how to incentivise independent reviews and analysis is an issue as there's not much incentive to write a truly independent review when you only get paid if its a flattering one.

the token industry is more than a little broken but it could so easily be set right again if there were community standards that new token companies should comply with.

these are similar rules to what I believe Kickstarter is now using (after many early products didn't come to light after raising funds).  for instance, kickstarter now makes companies show they have a real prototype product and not just a mockup.

how it relates to token companies - they must have a tech team capable of delivering on the promise in the white paper.   must show a working prototype (on the blockchain) of the tech to prove that not only can it be built, but that you know how to build it.

the problem is many token companies these days just write highly creative white papers and make outlandish claims about the market size and how they can disrupt it and they just brush aside their tech and imply its a done deal without proving they even have any developers or any proof they know what theyre doing.   show that they know how to run a company or manage a team.  show that they know anything about project management and have a clue how to deliver what theyre claiming.  bonus points if they have past track records of similar complexity projects.  even more bonus points if their proof of concept is an actual blockchain proof and not just any old piece of software they bought or built that theyre claiming they can blockchainify in the course of time.  anyone can claim that but not everyone can do that.  the community should be more discerning.

It so happens that if you can nail that story part right you can industrialize ICO creation and that's exactly what happened.

You may be surprised to know that most ICO companies today employ more business and marketing people than competent technologists... But we can't place all the blame on promoters. Investors are just as bad as promoters (often the same, kek.) You would think they would be happy for you to help out a project they supposedly support but all they care about in the end is whether their bags can be made lighter.

See, no one really gives a shit about any of these projects. Not even the founders. The moment they have their profits locked-in they will exit their positions faster than you can say shitcoin.

I don't think they are an illusion of progress, more we humans have just gotten too fixated with a new shiny thing. The ICO-TGE is a very clever and novel way to move capital to a place of need-want quickly. That being the case and ppl being able to Kickstarter any company they wanted meant profits and humans are greedy.

I feel that 99% of tokens are not needed. I'm not going to argue all of them but in most cases you could use ETH instead of said token. If you replaced the token with ETH and the system didn't break... Then you don't need it. So I agree with the abuse.

While you mention being too focused on the token, there is still some amazing research going on in developing token models where the token is actually useful. You will see the herd move to the next thing once you have a working product of substantial impact that ppl grasp easily. ICOs are pretty easy to grasp, invest and get rich anywhere in the world in 10 minutes or less. 

An example that is more recent is TCRs, token curated registries where using a prime coin like ETH. The best TCR probably wouldn't affect the price of ETH so a more volatile asset makes sense. If you don't know about TCRs I suggest checking out Mike Goldin's post on it here: ¨¹Token-Curated Registries 1.0¨¹ https:--medium.com-@ilovebagels-token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7

The other is ERC-721s aka CryproKitties. While it's not even really a game, the new concept of a completely unique digital asset stored immutably is pretty cool. The problem is besides collectibles what else can we use them for? Right now no one really knows because it's still too new. One of the coolest features is that a 721 token can 'own' another token. So you can buy a hat for your CryproKitty. You own the cat, the cat owns the hat . This opens up the possibility to interoperating assets which is neato imo.

103,dw8d4tl,"Ive been playing it, and so far Ive only made two moves (first game I won by no-show). My suggestions: 

You really should not have every move on chain, to have every stone placement cost 0.10 is unnecessary. Its not as hard as it sounds to make a state channel, youve done the hardest bits already: implementing the rules of go in solidity. 

Now all you need to do is allow someone to play by signing an ethereum message and sending a move to the other player and implement a 72 hour dispute resolution period. In theory this alone should do the trick: if I have your full move history and you refuse to resign, I can make a dispute resolution and upload every move until you I win the game. Look for ecrecover and youll see its quite easy. 

You dont even need to upload the whole move history: if you have on each move message, a hash of the board state, your move and a hash of the previous move, then I can recover the full board state just by having the last two transactions in which both players agree on s agree on a board state. Make so that ending games by dispute resolution is much more costly to the losing side, so they¨¹ll always prefer resigning.

People talk about ""centralization"" yet say nothing about thousands of GPUs being bought before they even hit retail.

Also think about it. If a fork happens they will just make a new version that can adapt. Maybe this time they won't even bother to sell them at all but ""test"" them for months or longer. Without any examples there is no longer a way to fork is there?

If this mythical ""Proof of Stake"" is really going to happen this year. There is no need to fork anyway. Just make the change and end this horrible waste of energy.

152,dwfrney,"Yes, I support a fork that fixes permanently ASIC mining, a couple of things are needed to ever prevent this from happening again.

* Before any action is taken it needs to somehow be verified that ASIC miners either already exist or are being readied to be sold. We need to make sure we don't over-react anytime there is an unverified story of an ASIC miner.

* Add ETH ASIC sniffing platform to determine using various ASIC detection schemes (not open source for obvious reasons) when ASIC mining has been detected of significant hash rate. For example looking at the significant hash rate increase over the last few months and their locations can help determine. There are other methods as well of detecting ASICs.

* Like Monereo did, as soon as ASIC mining is detected or verified take quick and decisive action to circumvent the ASIC miners. This is very important because they will not spend money developing future ASICs if they know you will immediately make a change once they are detected. 

* It is well believed that BitMain has been mining ETH now for a few months, look at the rise in difficulty if you doubt. Every day that goes by of inaction increases the likely hood they will do this again. We must take quick action immediately.

I have been mining ETH for a few years now and have been scratching my head the last few months as difficulty was increasing and price falling. I was confused because there have been absolutely zero mining motherboards and zero GPUs of scale to buy so I could not figure out where all the additional hash rate was coming from. I have plenty of wholesale contacts and none of them have been able to get inventory.

The reason for the huge difficulty increase now seems very clear, Bitmain already has running ASIC ETH miners. This is the reason for the huge run up in difficulty and the reason for the large ETH-BTC price decline as BitMain sells their mined ETH. I am not talking ETH-USD price, I am talking the relative decline of ETH versus BTC which has gone from .123 to .057, over a 50% decline in Ethereum versus Bitcoin in the last two months. Looking at the price this way removes the market decline that the whole crypto space has been in.

The Ethereum Foundation needs to move very quickly, like Monero did, and make a protocol change in the mining algo to prevent ASIC mining. Inaction means ETH will continue to fall in price as we all know that ASIC mining costs are typically 100x lower than GPUs. They can mine profitably with 2x higher difficulty and ETH@$50. This is what is coming unless the Foundation acts very quickly.",2018-03-29 04:13:00

Secondly, from the ethereum whitepaper: ""However, one notably interesting feature of this algorithm is that it allows anyone to ""poison the well"", by introducing a large number of contracts into the blockchain specifically designed to stymie certain ASICs.""

The problem I see is a lack of ASIC manufacturer alternatives, and the question is why the western nations thought it was a good idea to outsource all chip manufacturing to one admittedly less than democratic country.

Additionally, as others have pointed out, there are really only two GPU manufacturers available, so this isn't really a solution either.

 Such a person-group could easily then destroy the entire network, simply by mining in the shadows. Feels like a double edged sword. I read something about that on the Monero subreddit, but was curious as to how-why this can be a threat. 




Isn't the problem more so that, if you join a pool, you forfeit your ""voting rights"" so to say? In Bitcoin when Seg2x happened, I'm pretty sure that originally Bitmain people didn't want Segwit, but they were eventually forced to do so, because people allocated differently in their miningpools and forced reactions that way. 



Lastly it's also a question of will it be worth it in the future. Assuming most projects dumb the idea of PoW alltogether, because it's wasteful energy in their eyes. The argument against this would obviously be that you lose security if you do so and distributed hash power in theory is the most secure structure you can possibly have. So ultimately I wonder whether more competition in the ASIC field is what we want, given all they do is produce mashines, that can do more SHA256 than the latest one. A GPU has utility besides mining and is used by everyone, so centralization is less of a problem here. But to me it feels dangerous, limiting mining to only GPU, simply because some real smart dude could at any point come a long, create a new FUCKUASICv2 and mine in the shadows until he feels like destroying the entire network.

If they have developed something I'm still undecided. How far away is full PoS? Will the risk of centralization up until that point outweigh the risk of making a change to the algo?

I like the idea of ASIC resistance and having GPUs secure the network, but I also wonder if this is really such a big a deal as people are making it out to be when we're eventually just going to switch to PoS.

Overall I'm still highly skeptical of the rumor, not because I think Eth ASICs would be impossible, but because I have to wonder whether the R&D, etc., would be worth it for Bitmain when they know full PoS is coming, and they know their potential customers know this. I'm not a miner so I haven't crunched the numbers, but I'd have to wonder how long it might hypothetically take to recover an ASIC investment on Ethereum (which I guess we wouldn't know until we saw the specs).

1. Show that BitMain actually has a miner. A random 10 second YouTube video of an AntMiner with a trivially replaceable sticker on top of it, isn't compelling.

2. (I haven't seen him say this, but I reckon he'd probably agree), show that it's a problem. If their hypothetical miner existed but ate twice the power of a GPU setup with the same hash rate, the only reason you'd use the ASIC is because you can't get the GPUs. Who do you think are the guys buying the GPUs? The guys who would use ASIC miners.

24,dwl7jrj,"No. All of the problems with the proposal:

1. PoW means competition through producing hashes. That's what Bitmain is doing. Changing the rules to destroy the investment Bitmain made in designing a chip is competing with Bitmain through *political means*. The roadmap was PoW until PoS was implemented. Bitmain is competing fairly, in finding ways to produce hashes more efficiently in the time the roadmap has given for PoW. Changing the roadmap to hobble them will reward those who are better at political persuasion, at swaying the social consensus, over those who are better at efficiently producing hashes. 

2. PoS is coming soon. There's no need to add all of this controversy and complexity when at most ASICs will dominate Ethereum mining for 2 years.

3. There isn't a big difference between two manufacturers (NVidia and AMD) dominating mining hardware  and one (Bitmain). Additionally, ASICs are much easier to design than GPUs, with about a dozen companies now manufacturing them: https:--www.asicminervalue.com-manufacturers. So given enough time, the ASIC manufacturing market would actually start becoming more decentralized than the current GPU market.

4. Changing the rules would have terrible effects on incentives. Next time a company will just create an ASIC and keep its existence secret. It also creates an incentive for the mining sector to place people inside the Ethereum development team, in order to sway what hashing algorithm is adopted next, to get a jump on other mining hardware manufacturers in designing the next generation of ASICs-FPGAs-GPU-mining-software. This creates opportunities to exploit information asymmetry, and moves away from the pure free market that mining should be.

Some arguments for the proposal:

1. GPUs are more widely distributed, due to a large pre-existing installation base, which provides a more widely distributed potential mining base.

2. GPUs are produced for many other reasons besides mining, which means that it would be much harder for governments to ban or control their manufacturing.

Does ASIC mining pose a legitimate threat to Etherium? If so, can you explain how and back it with evidence?

So the fact that one company makes ASICs and preuses them in testing their quality for themselves doesn't bug me. Unless one can *prove* they consistently own 51+ % of the hashrate for sustained periods of time. If this is true and it's provable, worry not about this part of my dissent. Does this manufacturer have more than 51% of mining nodes?

Another question is, if they are a majority miner; with the highest percentage of hashrate, irrelevant if they have >51% or not; Are they provably using their mining power negatively?

3,dwlx3mf,"The whole point of ASIC resistance is supposed to be ""decentralization"".  But that premise directly conflicts with the entire basis of proof-of-work, which is that the network gains security by making it expensive to rewrite the blockchain, due to the energy costs of computation.  ASICs make it more expensive in more ways than just increasing the hashrate; they also increase the cost of a chain collapse (which could be caused by successful double-spends, or the public becoming aware of collusion between miners, and leading to a massive market dump).  Why? Because an ASIC has no use other than mining coins that use its hash algorithm.  

To put it another way, a $1m investment in ASICs is MUCH riskier than a $1m investment in GPUs, because GPUs retain most of their value if the chain you're mining dies.  Even if every GPU-mineable coin collapsed, GPUs would still have market value.  Not so with ASICs.  

Furthermore, the main point of PoW or PoS is to use incentives to turn natural selfish greed into the very force that secures the network.  When people start talking about Bitmain being greedy, they seem to be missing the point of most cryptocurrencies, and I think it's really not even the greed that they resent.  Rather, what bothers people is that Bitmain seems to be one of the only players that is greedy enough to invest in this tech, and the lack of competition is the real problem. I doubt ASICs would bother ANYONE if there were 4 or 5 big companies all competing to make the best and cheapest ASICs.

So no, I'm not in favor of a hard fork to resist ASIC miners, I think GPU mining is inherently less secure, and I think it also sets a dangerous precedent that discourages other potential ASIC producers from entering the market.  After all, why would any company want to enter a market where not only are they at a disadvantage against the major player due to being new and unproven, but they also have to contend with the fact that the community could turn around and hard fork to a different algo and make all their R&D worthless?

I think we as a community should encourage competition in the ASIC market, rather than keep trying to put a band-aid on the centralization problem by hard-forking every time an ASIC comes out.

I am very against-EIP 960. I think that's an uphill battle, unfortunately, because people somehow have learned that 0% Inflation = Maximum value, and that couldnt be further from the truth. People think that if there is 0% inflation, then whatever ETH or BTC they have will always have a fixed % of the total supply, and their value will never go down.

But Inflation has a purpose; it allows networks to grow, it encourages spending, and discourages hoarding. This encourages dApp use and network activity, which is how ETH gets its value in the first place. We need inflation!!",2018-04-03 02:40:00

1,dwub30x,"Yes, absolutely. 

Below is a response from me to someone on another outlet.

PoS done right is still about a year or so away, and will likely begin with a hybrid PoW-PoS strategy.  These ASIC machines remove the ability for the majority of the masses to be able to participate in mining and moves deeply closer to centralizing Ethereum - a notion that goes agains a major keynote from the Ethereum whitepaper - that is decentralization.  

Mining Ethereum and other Ethash coins brings a lot of new people into the crypto space as well.   Furthermore,  the majority of the Ethereum community is against the use of ASICS as depicted at github and reddit, etc.  Bitmain should concentrate on providing ASICS to the communities that welcome them.  

The Ethash algorithm, an algorithm that prides itself as being ASIC resistant has been compromised - this affects more than just Ethereum.  This issue goes very deep and will have severely undesired consequences, not fully realized until it's likely too late. 

The Monero community gave Bitmain the first warning with their anti-ASIC strategy and now is the time for the Ethereum community to deliver a second warning.  

I welcome a fork to bring ASIC resistance, wholeheartedly.   Much respect to the hardworking devs and to the community for speaking up.",2018-04-05 15:25:00

2) Impedes the Bitmain-centralization effect

If Ethereum goes with the 'hard fork every 6 months' strategy, mining companies could try to place people inside the development community, to steer decisions on the selection of a new hashing algorithm that they are already working on mining software for. 

More regular hard forks also requires socially centralizing the community more to make hard forks easier to organize.

Either way, depending on reactionary-periodic changes to the hashing algorithm coordinated through social consensus to maintain ASIC resistance will increase information asymmetry and with it, centralization.

That being said, I do want to point out that the move to an ASIC resistant PoW algorithm a) hurts the ASIC miners more than you, and b) is a minor change compared to PoS (which is coming soon and has been a part of the roadmap since day 1).

Furthermore, I think it's important to reaffirm _who the blockchain is for_. We're not building a blockchain for miners (ASIC or not). We're not building a blockchain for coin holders (so, sorry, they shouldn't control the _entire_ governance process).

We're building a blockchain for users. After all, Ethereum is a platform for decentralized applications. And so users wishes are the ones we should worry about.

*EDIT 1: Just to clarify, I don't think that PoS is building a blockchain for coin-holders. Validators have a very limited role (just build the blockchain!) and are punished if they try to break users safety guarantees! I think this tweet from Vitalik [here](https:--twitter.com-VitalikButerin-status-971396650139701251) makes a nice analogy about this.*

Yeah so, ASICs are an iterative innovation, those happen. You have generated enough profit over time to adjust to the market changes, that's the basics of business, and if you mismanaged your profits, you deserve to fail. That's the market.



Asking a central group to make adjustments to a system to benefit you is called lobbying for regulations. That's full on anti-crypto right there. Y'all need to get right.

https:--pdaian.com-blog-anti-asic-forks-considered-harmful- 

The article is written by Philip Daian, a respected academic researcher in the cryptocurrency space. Here is my summary - what I took away:

Basically the author makes a really good point that small GPU miners were already being squeezed out by more advanced GPU miners due to ""economics of scale"". I.e. largest miners can negotiate cheaper electricity, cheaper hardware, have more advanced & efficient operations. Plus the current ASIC hardware doesn't give that much advantage, see article for details. The author stresses that all of this is a short term problem which would require a lot of dev resources, better to move on and focus the resources on transitioning to PoS and Sharding.

The other point the author made was that anti-ASIC hardfork could actually end up benefiting large players like bitmain in the long term. For eg. Now that Monero hashrarate dropped 80% there is now incentive for building a new ASIC chip for the new alogo. Bitmain, having the most advanced production line, can get out the new chips faster than any competition. This further cements their position, even if the chips have a small advantage of PoW, it is still enough to to drive out the smaller players.",2018-04-09 08:39:00

If that's the case then that's a good thing as then ASIC competition will emerge everyone will use ASICs and this will result in the network no longer being vulnerable to the attack vector of ASICs. ASICs are only an attack vector if only the attacker has ASICs. If everyone has ASICs no such attack vector exists. Forking whenever we publicly know about an ASIC is just a cat and mouse game and it doesn't protect against ASICs in covert  we don't know about. 

Are we in this to make money? Or are we in this to secure the network? Our job as miners is to do the later.

3,dx2anng,"Hey guys -- as a dev heavily involved in the Bitcoin Cash community, I want to offer some free advice.

I am enjoying reading the debate regarding PoS vs PoW in here.  Lively discussion is always stimulating.

I really want to caution this community against moving to PoS prematurely or in the near future.   I think PoS is an intriguing idea and would be a great experiment -- there is a lot of risk involved.

Why?

I have been following cryptos for 6 years now and I have come to an uncomfortable conclusion.  Cryptos derive their value from (1) future expectations that they will be useful and take over the world, and (2) present-day costs in producing a new supply of them.  Difficulty follows price which follows difficulty. It's a chicken-and-egg that somehow supports itself.

One of the main goals of PoS is to reduce the costs of the network by eliminating mining for the production of new coins and-or for securing the network.  I am not sure if this is a good thing in the market *as it stands now*.  

It could be a nail in the coffin for the price of ETH.

We need to be realistic -- right now there isn't any real demand for cryptos beyond dreamers like you and me that believe in a better tomorrow..  and miners *today* that are very hesitant to sell their newly minted coins for less than they paid (in fiat) to create them (and speculators, but we can ignore them as it can be argued they don't produce 'real' demand, only speculative demand).  This last factor -- the miners refusing to part with coins at a (fiat) loss -- creates (fiat) price pressure and also hooks ETH to a highly networked real-world currency like the USD or EUR.  

Thus, through mining, a minimum base price that resists being broken through unless the market turns super-sour is created.

I'm oversimplifying here -- and there's lots of chaos in the system created by speculators -- plus legacy HODLers that got their coins essentially for pennies -- but the overall trend over time is that the cost of producing new coins heavily influences price (and vice versa). People tend to resist selling a coin for less than $100 if it cost them $100 to produce it. Thus, some price pressure is created. Over time, if you can look at the big picture, the trend for all crytpos to gain in fiat price is linked to the fiat costs of producing the crypto's supply.  It's clear as day if you zoom out far enough on the timeline.

I think if you move to a 100% PoS coin and remove the energy costs (read: fiat costs) from the equation -- you may find surprising (fiat) price action as a result.  Without the price pressure associated with miners refusing to sell coins at a loss, the risk of price collapse becomes more likely and bearish markets can turn into black-friday-style panics more easily, tanking the price.  

Electricity costs are one of the few links ETH (or any crypto) has to fiat price.  Cut that link, and you are asking for trouble.

I think ETH will be ready for PoS when there is more of a real-world economy priced in ETH (or BCH, or BTC, or whatever).  When you can buy raw materials and pay for labor in ETH, and that labor pays for food and housing in ETH, and everything is priced in ETH -- then PoS can be stable.  Before that point, it's all funny money and the only thing hooking it to reality is the fiat cost of electricity to produce a crypto.  Remove that cost -- and your funny money can turn to nothing -- no matter how clever a PoS system is.

That being said -- I'd love to live in a reality where PoS would work.  A reality where things are priced in cryptos and PoS is viable, as we no longer need to hook ourselves into the fiat economy.

Tl;Dr: Energy costs act as a 'hook' grounding cryptos to fiat.  Divorce yourself from fiat by remove that hook via PoS and, in the current market, unhappiness can result.

My two cents.  Do with this information as you will.

Blockchains only exist because they're decentralized and have consensus. **if this is not the case then it doesn't make any sense. Go use a RMDBS instead**.

I urge the community and developers to defend a hardfork changing the PoW algorithm.

Who cares, really? Monero is the prime example. Monero forks every 6 months and they're on the version 12 now. There are 4 different initiatives that appropriated the version 11 network. FOUR! Everyone knows these are just money-grab opportunities, including Bitmain itself! Yep, Bitmain is supporting one of these initiatives (their Bitcoin pool, AntPool, started a XMO pool, lol). No one cares about them, really. Wow, what a cool project, they're a previous version of Monero without many of the improvements that Monero XMR implemented in version 12.

The community understood that changing the PoW was just to break Bitmain. This is completely different from Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash or even Ethereum vs. Ethereum Classic. This is not a ""different way to go forward"", it's literally **protecting the blockchain from malicious entities!**",2018-04-09 21:16:00

It's also arguable current Ethereum mining has negative social consequences: videogamers have a hard time affording their GPUs, and ether distribution is unlikely to even out when early adopters bought their share for a penny on the dollar compared to newcomers. 


Not to advocate redistribution of wealth, but implementing features for the sake of preserving wealth inequality seems just as ill-advised. Why not let things play out until there's an actual attack?

3,dx34q2u,"Let's consider the events that would needed of occured for Bitmain to pose an immediate centralization threat.

Bitmain would of had to begin development of their Eth ASIC product long enough ago that they have completed their lead time (typically 1-6 months for an asic). By doing this they would of developed their product completely in stealth mode (not unheard of)

Bitmain would of had to develop this product  completely unfunded for this project (for an ASIC of this complexity likely several million in development). Again possible but unlikely

They would then need to manufacture enough hashing power to hold a candle to the currently available hashing bulk all while outproducing all of the other players in the field. They would need to outproduce the sum of nvidia and AMD products entering mining.

I don't know much about Bitmain but I do know a bit about electronics development and work in manufacturing. My guess is that bitmain currently has a very small amount of hashing power and are generating hype-funds for their product to fund its development and-or scale up manufacturing. 

That being said though if they did pose no centralization risk you'd think they would be more open about it as to save public image",2018-04-10 03:37:00
4,dx373d1,"In blockchain world, You do not need to trust anyone.  ",2018-04-10 04:12:00
7,dx38lb3,"Of course we shouldn't (and can't trust) Bitmain. The whole objective of crypto is to create a permissionless trustless system. We must work to prevent any actor from having 51%+ of the hashrate.

The thing is the only way to achieve this is to encourage and foster competition in the ASIC market so that there is competition against Bitmain and we don't have any reason to require their trust.

If we take an anti ASIC approach and fork as many here may suggest the consequence of that is that we won't see ASIC competition as any small players will view it as too risky to invest in R&D for something that may be bricked. So only those who are large enough like Bitmain would develop ASICs and use them in covert. Then we wind up with a scenario where we must trust them.

However if we encourage ASICs development and embrace ASICs then competition against Bitmain will emerge much like how it has with Bitcoin where Bitmain competes against eBang, Canaan, BitFury, and Halong and since there will be no risk to the manufacture of a fork then companies like Bitmain will also happily sell their ASICs to the public rather than keep them all to themselves.

The only way we can stop a need to trust Bitmain is to beat them at their own game. We can not do so if we discourage competition.

Do not be mistaken and conflate the dev teams take on ASICs as pro Bitmain or for those of us who advocate in the favor of ASICs as being one who wants to trust Bitmain or for them to have power. This is about accepting or rejecting ASICs on principle, Bitmain is but a mere participant in this market. If you understand how proof of work secures a blockchain then you are well aware that the only way to prevent an attacker with ASICs from attacking is for the good guys to defend the network with ASICs of their own.

Sounds like PoW will be around for quite a while yet. With PoS being an added layer of protection against a 51% attack. Bring on the ASICs!

Seems like a fair compromise to me, honestly. The reality of the situation is (as outlined in the article), is that ASICs and mining can centralize to favor one party. This puts the entire blockchain at risk. However, with periodic PoS validators there to add checkpoints, it helps to protect against PoW wrongdoers. And if you try to cheat in PoS, you lose your wallet funds.

I suppose its still possible to get a 2-3rds majority AND a 51% hash rate to just completely destroy the coin. And being very successful at PoW mining would probably incline you to become a bonded validator. But the penalty is pretty steep for a fuck up.

I understand and appreciate the dilemma this puts miners in, and if I had made a significant investment into mining equipment, I would also likely be upset.

But fundamentally, the purpose of the Foundation is to create a secure, scalable, and well-adopted - used network. 
 Anything beyond this takes the Foundation's attention away from those three things and is a potential distraction.

It is not the job of the Foundation to ensure that miners get their ROI on their mining equipment - graphics cards.  All miners knew the risks when they purchased their hardware.  And miners can still likely recoup some or all of that investment by mining other coins if needed (this is the free market at work).  Ethereum was designed to be ASIC-resistant, but there was never a ""blood pact"" that it would be kept ASIC-proof indefinitely.  Any smart miner knew the risk of that equipment being rendered less useful through the eventual introduction of an ASIC.

I want to see Casper live, along with the many other items on the Ethereum roadmap.  These are the most important priorities for the future of this network and require the Foundation and the community to be laser focused upon them if we are to be successful- especially with new competition continuing to enter the picture.  Mining is soon to be a thing of the past regardless of the introduction of ASICs.  And making this change isn't free- it will take substantial time and coordination to make it happen.  That energy will necessarily pull the community from more future-leaning priorities.

If this is not an existential threat to the network, and so far I have no seen conclusive evidence that it is, then I do not believe it requires any action on the part of the Foundation. Especially if it will be ameliorated by other solutions in the somewhat near future. But if it is a real threat to the viability of the network, then yes, the Foundation should address it.  Finally, your point on a version of Casper that could be deployed quickly in the event of an attack is an important data point.  For me, that satisfies maintaining the status quo on this issue at this time.

Expect the price in fiat to tank.

PoW is one of the few things hooking a crypto into the real-world (fiat) economy.

Without the cost of electricity to produce a crypto -- it's very possible for the price to collapse very quickly and for people to flee the crypto as a result.  Believe it or not, the cost to produce new ETH is one of the factors keeping the price up.  It gives ETH some ""baseline"" value -- few miners would sell new coins at a loss.  This fact affects the market and price.

Without this cost (in fiat) -- a PoS system which works entirely pricing everything in ETH will mean ETH no longer has any real-world economic hooks to fiat and it runs the risk of price (in fiat) collapse.

I find it unbelievable that the devs or that more people don't realize this.

Please do not switch to PoS now.  Doing so will be a grievous error.  Please switch once more real world goods are priced in ETH.  At that point it would be entirely safe to do so.

2. White paper is just that. A piece of (digital) paper. Anyone who has ever created anything that has a concrete plan, design doc, or theory KNOWS that things never go as planned. Ethereum is still ASIC resistant. Look how long it took to create one, and how few gains were achieved by creating one. Don't confuse ""resistant"" with ""proof"".

We have no evidence that this is the extent of Bitmain's capability. These stats were made public by Bitmain after the discussion started based on videos leaked showing someone using an E3 mining at 600MH-s at 750W (more than double what Bitmain now claims) and people universally started calling for a hard fork, and after that announcement (just as Bitmain wanted) people are now citing these new stats so that people will back off.  That's concerning. 

We have no way of knowing that this is the same miner Bitmain may use internally.  What if they are able to make a miner at double this efficiency and simply sell the reduced capacity miner to the public so that this will be PDN #1 and prevent the fork?  I strongly suspect you guys are being manipulated and it's a shame to see this PDN #1, which may be pure manipulation and propoganda from Bitmain, being cited as fact.

This is well within a circuit designer's capability.  Do you really think Bitmain invested huge sums of money into the E3 knowing that they would only get a 2.5x benefit? I don't. The originally leaked 600Mh-S at 750W is much more likely. ",2018-04-12 10:35:00

4,dx80wmt,"Why Be Memory-Hard?
The main reason why memory hardness is important is to make the proof of work function resistant to specialized hardware. With Bitcoin, whose mining algorithm requires only a simple SHA256 computation, companies have already existed for over a year that create specialized ""application-specific integrated circuits"" (ASICs) designed and configured in silicon for the sole purpose of computing billions of SHA256 hashes in an attempt to ""mine"" a valid Bitcoin block. These chips have no legitimate applications outside of Bitcoin mining and password cracking, and the presence of these chips, which are thousands of times more efficient per dollar and kilowatt hour at computing hashes than generic CPUs, makes it impossible for ordinary users with generic CPU and GPU hardware to compete.

This dominance of specialized hardware has several detrimental effects:

It negates the democratic distribution aspect of cryptocurrency mining. In a generic hardware-dominated ecosystem, the fact that everyone has a computer guarantees that everyone will have an equal opportunity to earn at least some of the initial money supply. With specialized hardware, this factor does not exist; each economic actor's mining potential is linear (in fact, slightly superlinear) in their quantity of pre-existing capital, potentially exacerbating existing wealth inequalities.
It increases resource waste. In an efficient market, marginal revenue approaches marginal cost. Since mining revenue is a linear function of money spent on mining hardware and electricity, this also implies that total revenue approaches total cost. Hence, in a specialized hardware dominated ecosystem, the quantity of resources wasted is close to 100% of the security level of the network. In a CPU and GPU-dominated ecosystem, because everyone already has a computer, people do not need to buy specialized hardware for the first few hashes per second worth of mining power. Hence, revenue is sublinear in cost - everyone gets a bit of revenue ""for free"". This implies that the quantity of resources wasted by the network is potentially considerably lower than its security parameter.
It centralizes mining in the hands of a few actors (ie. ASIC manufacturers), making 51% attacks much more likely and potentially opening the network up to regulatory pressure.

4,dx8bfmm,PDN 1: No information Bitmain releases should be trusted. E3 announcement looks a bit too much like it's main point was to keep Ethereum from forking POW by releasing ASIC that loses in efficiency to some GPUs with vague disclaimer that they expect stats to get better. Couple that with almost 4 months to delivery. I'm 100% sure that what people will get at July is either much faster or they are getting defective ones or early prototypes.,2018-04-12 14:39:00
7,dx8d1kw,"As a long time computer enthusiast and builder, I am going to express my PAR views by listing counters to the PDN statements - I don't expect anyone to care, but it will make me feel better.

*PDN 1: The efficiency gains accomplished by the ASIC is relatively limited. At the time this comment was made on the code devs call, Batch 1 of the Bitmain ASIC's sold for $800 for 180MH-s which is a 2.5x factor improvement over GPUs. Batch 2 now sells for $1,800, but the argument can still technically be made, albeit with a different improvement level. (35:38)*

**Rebuttal to PDN 1:** A typical 200MH,  800 watt rig is made up of 7 x 1070's plus comp. hardware.  This costs at a minimum $3000 to $3500 .  This is a 4.37x cost difference to batch 1.  The second batch would be ~2x improvement, but batch one revealed that these units cost less than a few hundered dollars to make most likely.  How would anyone ever compete with the price of  Bitmain rigs? Not to mention they are heavily influencing the price of Ether at the same time. We are also at their mercy for pricing.  Ever buy an Antminer and find out its $500 less then you paid within a week.  You don't get burned this bad on GPU's, ever.

*PDN 2: We are unsure what protocol changes would make a difference. Even if we switch to a PoW algorithm that is entirely different and not I-O bound at all, such as SHA3, it may only buy us 6-12 months. (37:37)*

**Counter to PDN 2:** Buying any time at all is worth it to miners and in limiting control stake in the network.  Monero cut their hash in 1-2 and miners are profitable again.  It may be temporary but it is awesome. Six to twelve months in the crypto world is an eternity.  

*PDN 3: The development effort to change the PoW algorithm and getting everyone to upgrade would be chaotic and risky. Developing, testing, planning, and enacting a hard fork and related code is not a simple process. (38:47)* 

**Rebuttal to PDN 3:** Ethereum has forked before.  I am not an expert nor claim to be, but Monero just did it, and the Ethereum team has done it before.  There were some glitches, but we all survived.  We have all waited for Casper this long, we can wait longer.

*PDN 4: Focusing on changing the PoW algorithm would detract from more important things, such as Casper, sharding, and other protocol level work. (38:47)
PDN 5: The Ethereum network is switching to proof-of-stake (Casper) soon, so changing the PoW algorithm detracts from the research and development. Changing the PoW algorithm would serves as a band-aid while Casper is both an eventuality and a permanent solution.*

**Counter to PDN 4 and 5:** - These two sound exactly the same to me, and the band-aid may prevent a Bitmain infection prior to POS (pardon the pun)

*PDN 6: The worst case scenario is that Bitmain controls a large portion of the Ethereum network for some time. If they try to use it for malicious purposes, Casper development can be sped up, launched in a week (albeit with potentially more bugs and skipping formal verification-academic review), and mining rewards would go down by 90%. If geth and Parity start making it a higher priority to implement Casper it would provide us with some insurance in the case of a 51% attack.(39:05)*

**Rebuttal to PDN 6:** - Launch Casper in a week?  And if Bitmain (Asic's)  control the network they would also control a majority of the coins by then, poisoning Casper. I don't get the logic here. You would have stopped them from mining , but the bear will already be in the cabin.

*PDN 7: It is impossible to prevent anti-competitive economies of scale from forming around mining. Large corporations and entities will achieve economies of scale in any mining model, including general purpose hardware - GPU-dominated mining (see Phil's blog I previously referenced).*

**Counter to PDN 7:** - This happens in any business. Yes more money means more equipment, but at least we all have a relatively equivalent opportunity to obtain the same mining equipment, not controlled by a single source.  We all are now able to compete against each other on a level playing field, not one defined by a few people with access to ASIC chips and fab factories.  Like someone said, ""mom & pop's"" survive just fine even though McDonalds is around because ""we all have to buy the same chicken and cows.""

*PDN 8: Anti-ASIC forks reduce the cost to attack a cryptocurrency substantially and are a good thing for the security of a cryptocurrency system (see Phil's blog I previously referenced).*

**Rebuttal to PDN 8:**  Wow, Phil is smart and makes good points, but his final argument about attack costs just isn't right. When one supplier is supplying all the hardware which they control, how easy would it be for them to remote control their device or do  nefarious deeds?  It's very easy when the code is closed source and no one knows what it is really capable of doing.  I am sorry Phil but I trust a variety of PC's that are mostly run  and built by paranoid hacker-miners than a single company. Do you really think that ASIC's (execuse me, ""specialized hardware"") coming from a single source is better protection?! For who??  Also, I am not buying the ""Rent"" vs. ""Buy"" argument for attacking networks.  It would be so much easier to set up a million antminers then a zillion computers.  The Antminers are like drones, good luck getting 100 computers to follow your commands let alone 1000's of them.   I would like to debate Phil's points one at a time but that would take all night.

The real reason to push for the algorithm change to me is because building computers, toying with hardware, coding and testing software for mining is just fun for all of us hobbyists,hackers, and geeks.  When specialized hardware (ASIC's) ruined the fun in 2014 for  Litecoin enthusiasts, it really sucked and the fun went away until Ethereum came around.  Now I fear that fun is disappearing.  There are only a few good coins left that really try to be for everyone - Vertcoin, Monero, Zcash, & Pascal Coin (soon as  PIP9 is complete,to knock out the stupid Baikal miner)

So hopefully Ethereum will change the algorithm, or everyone will be buying specialized hardware and waiting for Casper come around some time in 2019.

The chance of a 51% attack from Bitmain is actually really low. They never did it on Bitcoin as far as I know.

But as Vitalik said on Twitter, the fear is unfounded at the moment (money earned from hashpower has not been going down). And also, the community as a whole has to weigh caring about miners against focusing on development (from which a hard fork would distract).",2018-04-12 17:16:00

Sure, batch 1 probably won't have a huge impact all by itself, but Vitalik's refusal to act against the ASICs gave Bitmain the green light to continue with batch 2 and probably more and more batches of the same E3 afterwards, since it's doubtful whether they can develop anything much stronger than it. 

The parts for the E3 are relatively cheap and available, so it's not impossible that they can take a large part of the network. Once this happens and difficulty rises through the roof again, the GPU miners will leave for easier coins and the ETH network will effectively become a property of Bitmain. I don't understand why we have to wait for this to happen to take action?

Another thing is that ETH miners are in fact the network and this way are ETH itself, so it baffles me when I see all the hate towards them in this subreddit. Very inappropriate and ungrateful from the community.",2018-04-12 18:04:00

56,dx8gunm,"I have only been vaguely aware of Deepak Chopra over the years, so coming into this kerfluffle I was neutral to positive about his presence at the event -- positive because I assumed he had a huge following.  I just checked out wikipedia:

Deepak Chopra (born October 22, 1946) is an American author, public speaker, alternative medicine advocate, and a prominent figure in the New Age movement.[3][4][5] Through his books and videos, he has become one of the best-known and wealthiest figures in alternative medicine.[6]

Chopra studied medicine in India before emigrating to the United States in 1970 where he completed residencies in internal medicine and endocrinology. As a licensed physician, he became chief of staff at the New England Memorial Hospital (NEMH) in 1980.[7] He met Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1985 and became involved with the Transcendental Meditation movement (TM). He resigned his position at NEMH shortly thereafter to establish the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center.[8] Chopra gained a following in 1993 after his interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show regarding his books.[9] He then left the TM movement to become the executive director of Sharp HealthCare's Center for Mind-Body Medicine and in 1996 he co-founded the Chopra Center for Wellbeing.[7][8][10]

From this I assume he is a very bright and probably caring individual who has done significant work in his life and reached many people.  He may have different and creative beliefs about how things work in the body and he may present his understanding of Ayurvedic and other systems in creative ways that are not aligned with the current state of mainstream science.  (Ethereum is not aligned with the current state of mainstream economic, social and political systems.)  Or he may be a charlatan intentionally lying to people to accumulate wealth.  I don't know and I am not currently in a position to judge, but I have to assume that with his long running success some people have derived benefit from his work over the years even if only via placebo effect.  Attitude and state of mind are very powerful and they can positively affect the physical.

Ethereal is a conference that focusses on cultural aspects of the decentralization phenomenon.  Ethereum is at its core.  Ethereum was and remains intended to be about freedom -- freedom of expression and elimination of external control and censorship.  

At ConsenSys we are doing our best internally to become as diverse and inclusive as we can to create a healthy and effective internal culture.  We seek out and openly evaluate diverse ideas.  We endeavor to investigate many situations and form our own opinions through discussion and, yes, seeking consensus.

I mean, are we risking a black swan event if we would implement Casper within a week? 

I agree a 51% attack is probably not in Bitmains best interest though, but the possibility is at least a little bit scary.

Sorry for the wall of text here, but figured I'd throw in my two cents (this is also the closest I've come to hitting Reddit's 10,000 character limit!)

----

I feel that ASICs are a form of Proof of Work maturity in the sense that the currency has grown enough where economies of scale forced the production of more efficient ways to mine. If a miner is only turning a $20 per month per machine profit after electricity costs, the time to break-even on an investment is much higher than if a more efficient solution were introduced. Ultimately, the goal of mining is seigniorage.

ASICs should not be viewed as a formidable commodity, rather, they should be seen as a tool. Tools are never intrinsically good or bad, some crypto developers even intend for their coin to eventually be used with an ASIC. Some coins, such as Sia, were designed to specifically work with an ASIC developed in part by the founding development team.

Switching gears to talk about ASICs and Ethereum for a moment.

Bitmain announced the E3 at a price of $800 per unit ($1,150 after power supply and shipping); a fraction of the cost of a GPU rig running the same speed, this meant that the barrier for entry was significantly lowered. At the new price of $1,800 per unit ($2,150 after power supply and shipping), this aligns the E3 with the price of a 180 MH-s mining rig. Since the hashrate and power are nearly the same, **IMO price point alone doesnt give the E3 a significant enough advantage to warrant a hard fork**, disregarding the possibility that a more powerful ASIC is being built to operate on the Ethereum mainnet.

The Ethash algorithm is notoriously memory hungry because it's tied to the amount of I-O events that can occur. The higher the number, the better the hashrate. A few community members speculate that the E3 has a large quantity of DDR3 modules on-board, if a more powerful ASIC exists, it would need to have more expensive modern memory, it's likely going to be a minuscule gain over the E3, not five or ten or twenty times the hashing power like some people are expecting.  It is unlikely that Bitmain will sink additional time and capital into the development of a faster Ethash ASIC to sell so close to the potential release of Casper, especially with the current hardware limitations and threat of their current technology being stymied.

----

The community is very much divided on the topic of ASICs, so this makes it a touchy subject and ddifficult to remain neutral on.

Some members are very passionate about the integrity of the network and potential of centralization. This feeling comes from the thought that If Bitmain is developing these ASICs, there is nothing to keep them from operating their own datacenter full of E3s. However, as confirmed by CNN, research firm Susquehanna confirmed that there were at least three other companies working on ASICs in [various stages of development](https:--www.ccn.com-bitmain-has-developed-an-ethereum-asic-miner-wall-street-analyst-claims-).

Other miners are concerned primarily about their falling profits. As we all know, it has always been a gual to transition token distribution PoW to PoS, making it unmineable. Until then, every coin counts. If the barrier of entry (cost) is removed by the introduction of a lower priced, more readily available miner, profits are threatened. Because the ASIC may have the potential to be bricked via a hard fork, miners that are more concerned over profit are cheering on said hard fork, looking at their best interest rather than increasing the global speed of the network. Some of these individuals have filled the mining subreddits with FUD, including manipulated photos and unverifiable claims of Bitmain's involvement with well-known websites-organizations.

During the latest crypto-boom, people were spending upwards of $4,500 (whereas MSRP pricing would have actually been closer to $1,9,900) on mining rigs with equivalent hashing power to the E3. Many people who bought into mining at this time were unlikely to make a profit with Ethereum. After raising the price to $1,800 per unit ($2,150 after accessories and shipping), it is unlikely for those that buy the E3 at current pricing to break-even by the launch of Casper, assuming it is launched by Q1 2019.

ETH's three pool centralization was at 60% with GPUs alone, something that the whitepaper specifically called out as being problematic with Bitcoin at 50%, including ASICs. Point being  centralization is not necessarily a problem caused solely by ASICs, but rather caused by economy of scale. As larger mining operations grow, even with GPUs, they can afford more hashing power much more quickly than the average in-home miner. As with any financially stimulating venture, mining is not excluded from profiteering. I have worked with clients who have warehouses full of GPUs; the centralization problem exists without the need for ASICs, I promise. It's just now coming to light because of Bitmain.

----

I dont believe that the Ethereum foundation or the core developers have mistreated the mining community at all. In fact, I believe that the course of actions currently being taken are levelheaded and emotions from the community are just running very high.

At this time, the developers have chosen not to emergency hard ard fork. Understand that this does not indicate that a hard fork will not take place in the future or as a part of a larger update.

During the April core dev meeting, the team clearly stated that they weren't yet sure how the ASICs operated, specifically said that they weren't sure if they could be ""programmed"", implying they may believe that it's an FPGA attached to a number of memory modules. If the ASICs could be updated to be unbricked, then the fork would have been for nothing and the problem returns. Given that Bitmain has never done this, it is highly unlikely to play out that way, however forking the second largest cryptocurrency (by market cap) over a theory is potentially disruptive.

A hard fork would require development resources to be removed from the development and launch of Casper re-focused on finding a suitable method to brick ASICs (at least one community member has been independently working on this) and perform a potentially disruptive event on mainnet.

Lastly, we need to address the falsification that Ethereum is ASIC-Proof or even technologically ASIC-Resistant. Hudson touched on this in the OP, but still reiterating it here.

Ethereum never promised that it would be ASIC-proof, merely that it would provide an economic incentive to be resistant to the development of an ASIC. I would like to produce a quote from the [Ethereum Wiki](https:--github.com-ethereum-wiki-wiki-Problems):

> Ultimately, perfect ASIC resistance is impossible; there are always portions of circuits that are going to be unused by any specific algorithm and that can be trimmed to cut costs in a specialized device. However, what we are looking for is not perfect ASIC resistance but rather economic ASIC resistance.

> The problem is that measuring an economy in a secure way is a difficult problem. The most obvious metric that the system has access to is mining difficulty, but mining difficulty also goes up with Moore's law and in the short term with ASIC development, and there is no known way to estimate the impact of Moore's law alone and so and so the currency cannot know if its difficulty increased by 10x due to better hardware, a larger user volume or a combination of both. Other metrics, such as transaction count, are potentially gameable by entities that want the supply to change in a particular direction (generally, holders want a lower supply, miners want a higher supply).¨¹

This is solidified by revisiting the whitepaper, specifically the section which identifies how ASICs will be economically stymied:

¨¹This model is untested, and there may be difficulties along the way in avoiding certain clever optimizations when using contract execution as a mining algorithm. However, one notably interesting feature of this algorithm is that it allows anyone to ""poison the well"", by introducing a large number of contracts into the blockchain specifically designed to stymie certain ASICs. The economic incentives exist for ASIC manufacturers to use such a trick to attack each other. Thus, the solution that we are developing is ultimately an adaptive economic human solution rather than purely a technical one.

So with the Ethereum team providing only an economic reason to not develop an ASIC since the beginning, there has been no falsification or wrongdoing in my eyes.

----

One of the core values of the ETH is that block rewards are to be distributed amongst miners in an egalitarian fashion; ultimately, this will be solved by Casper and the switch to PoS. We should also bring to light that PoW mining was always meant to become obsolete with the introduction of PoS on the Ethereum network.

Mining was always doomed from the start; it is just a ticking difficulty bomb waiting to explode.

Last December, it was estimated that the network could process somewhere around 10-20 transactions per second. As more ERC20 tokens are launched, the network becomes more congested and requires even more hashing power to efficiently (see the Crypto Kitties movement to understand just how disruptive network congestion can be). The Casper update seeks to speed up block times and enables network-wide sharding to reduce latency. ***IMO, this is what we need to be focusing on; a stable, tested release of Casper**, not a losing battle against ASICs.",2018-04-12 21:43:00

You technicality own the land on which is built your house (in same countries), but you cannot do whatever you want with it. You cannot for instance drill a 200m hole just for the fun of it or to bury your dead cat.

Money, is a vehicle of control and governance and we don't own money, we simply have some rights over them. Those rights go hand in hand with obligations as well and governments, as the ultimate power over national matters, may limit, temporarily or indefinitely, supposedly in the interests of the whole country, your rights to use that money.

Another aspect people often do not understand is that losing control over your money is much worse than losing control over your personal data, especially when those who control your data do that in their own personal interests. 

Losing the right to free speech, by targeted censorship, to free assembly, through bans and exclusion from political life are much worse than having your money seized. You can lose your identity, your medical records, your citizenship, any record that make you the individual you *are*, can be tempered with.

It is clear that John Doe doesn't care much about his rights to free speech as much as his rights to spend what he earned through hard work, but John Doe's rights to spend are often guaranteed by other mechanisms of balanced forces that act in John Doe's best interests. And those rights are the most valuable to us, yet we silently and unconsciously give them away in exchange of ""panem et circenses"".

So the question is not about gaining control over ""our"" money, rather gaining control on our data and share them as we see fit with whom we trust.

Because of this, it feels to me that the rewards are too high as a starting point- It seems like it would be better to start with lower rewards and then increase them as needed in the future, since upward adjustment will be far easier than downward adjustment.

Parity lost a large amount of fund for building a smart contract blockchain 'polkadot', they say the lost fund are not a problem for building it, if the product is a success they will have more than enought to restore back the value lost of the people affected by the multisig bug.

2,dxtz0mz,"Just to clear up any potential misconceptions here, as it appears some people may be operating under the incorrect assumptions: 

Neither Parity, nor the Web3 Foundation, nor to my knowledge any of the 573 individuals or projects affected by the multi-sig incident, called for, or initiated this coinvote. If we had, we would certainly have been more thoughtful about how it was constructed, in particular around how the community was engaged. We don't know who initiated the coinvote. 

There are hundreds of individuals affected by these locked funds who are seeking recovery. Parity is in conversations with many of these people and is putting forth these EIPs at their request and on their behalf. 

The majority of the funds locked belong to Web3 Foundation - which is a separate entity from Parity Technologies. Web3 Foundation is a Swiss non-profit, and our funds are already 100% committed to the research and development of decentralized tech. We've already committed to Ethereum Community Fund (https:--medium.com-ecf-review-what-happens-in-tokyo-doesnt-stay-in-tokyo-b406dd659b07) which funds Ethereum infrastructure initiatives, helped launch ETHPrize alongside Truebit, L4 and Status (which also supports Ethereum infrastructure initiatives: http:--ethprize.io), are working to support the continued development of decentralized exchanges (https:--medium.com-@web3-decentralized-exchanges-workshop-outcomes-4753dbd86f2b), worked with Giveth on addressing Ethereum scalability issues and partnering immediate scaling solutions with DApp developers (https:--medium.com-giveth-scalingnow-summit-transcript-ea5373be8523) and we're just getting started. For now, our support is largely in contributing our limited human resources to coordination, which is much needed but not enough. The funds that are currently locked were marked to be spent on supporting teams and independent devs & researchers who are working to build the tech stack to support a decentralized web. Without these funds, we don't have the resources to support Web 3.0 in the way we originally intended when we created the Web3 Foundation. Clearly we would like to see them recovered so we can put them back into the ecosystem in a meaningful way. ",2018-04-23 23:14:00

Personally, all things equal, I would be for returning all funds. The only thing to give me pause is the article by... some Ethereum developer... that showcases some of the unforeseen consequences of a contentious hard fork. Maybe we can mollify the community with a ""punishment"" that reduces the contentious-ness of a fork.

1) Don't hardcode the owner address. Add in a constructor that takes your address automagically when you deploy. Also include a function to change it in case you ever need to.

2) Don't use a function in the contract to look up existing 'lovers.' Web3 has a nifty getStorageAt() function that can pull data from the contract without making a transaction. If anything, it saves your users a fee as well.

3) This one's kinda tricky. You declared a ""uint public amountOfLovers"", but you declared it after an array. If you actually declared that next to your ""uint AmountInWei"" you would actually be able to use less storage (and therefore less gas for transactions) due to how the EVM compiles solidity. There's a great resource in the Web3 documentation that describes how declared values are put in storage. getStorageAt() also deals with this a lot too.

4) Add events in your contract! That way people can keep up in real-time when a new couple appears!

1,dxvf1uc,"The problem with any of these ideas, and they've been around long before blockchain, is that they create market imbalance. Severely underpriced tickets will be scooped up the moment an original buyer posts for sale. Someone who is willing to pay the most for a luxury good should get it. Basic free market economics. When you've owned your home for 30 years, should you only be allowed to sell it for the price you paid? Also, it's funny how people never complain about paying under face value for tickets, despite it being as equally unfair of a transaction as paying over face value. Why should the seller get less than he paid originally?

Regardless, it won't work. I can only sell the ticket for face of $50? Ok, well if someone is willing to pay $500, send me $450 in ethereum and then I'll do the $50.

The tickets have to be used by the original wallet? Ok, for $500 I'll give you my private key.

-Check your address on etherscan.io to see if you've been victimized by this hack yet.

-Transfer your funds off into a new wallet even if you haven't been victimized yet. DO NOT GO TO THE SITE TO DO THIS. Run MEW offline referencing the KB article here: https:--myetherwallet.github.io-knowledge-base-offline-running-myetherwallet-locally.html

**If you have used MEW in the last ~4 hours, accessing your account using *MetaMask* or *Ledger Nano S* or *Trezor*:**

-The only possible issue with hardware wallets is redirection of funds that were sent during the time of attack. There have been no reports of this yet.

-Your account itself, should be fine, since these options don't expose your private key online when signing transactions or accessing your account. Avoid using the MEW website until successful triage has been confirmed.

every time when you browse to a website (domain) youre browser needs to know on which server this website is located. for this you will make a DNS Server request. DNS Server are basically huge lists of an IP and a domain name.

After the request, your browser knows which IP and can process the request and the Server (myetherwallet.com) will respond you witht the website.

If somebody can hijack the DNS Server, which means he is able to change the IP address for the domain name, your browsers will  request the website from a wrong server. In this case, the server was in russia and already prepared from the attacker. The website looks and works identical, the only difference is, that all funds won't be send to the address you specified but to himself.

Your funds are save and pls do **not** visit the website untill the DNS attack is sovled and the developers give green light.


To protect yourself from future attacks pls follow the red bar of myetherwallet:

601,dy0z2ik,"Thanks for publishing! Can you try to summarize in a few sentences what the key innovation is and how it improves on your previous designs?

(The previous designs I would summarize as basically being NXT-style chain-based proof of stake, but using a fancy VRF scheme for pseudorandom proposer selection)

Edit: also, when you say ""composable"" proof of stake blockchains, what do you mean by that? What are you looking to compose Ouroboros with?

Edit 2: I did the digging myself. The algorithm uses a k-block revert limit to prevent long range attacks from hitting online nodes; for long-time offline nodes, it uses the following heuristic:

> Our new chain selection rule, formally specified as algorithm maxvalid-bg( (see Figure 9), surgically
adapts maxvalid-mc by adding an additional condition (Condition B). When satisfied, the new condition
can lead to a party adopting a new chain Ci even if this chain did fork more than k blocks relative to the
currently held chain Cmax. Specifically, the new chain would be preferred if it grows more quickly in the s
slots following the slot associated with the last block common to both Ci and Cmax (here s is a parameter of
the rule that we discuss in full detail in the proof). Roughly, this local chain growthappearing just after
the chains divergeserves as an indication of the amount of participation in that interval. The intuition
behind this criterion is that in a time interval shortly after the two chains diverge, they still agree on the
leadership attribution for the upcoming slots, and out of the eligible slot leaders, the (honest) majority has
been mostly working on the chain that ended up stabilizing.

Basically, if there are two chains C1 and C2, look at the N validatoidatoor slots right after where C1 and C2 diverge, and pick the chain that's ""denser"" within that range. So it's kinda GHOST-y in principle.

That said, there are limits to this kind of heuristic. If there's any point in the blockchain's history where less than some portion p of validators are online, and you can get your hands on old private keys for q > p of coins active then, then you can create a new history that appears to outperform the original.

It's also worth noting that Casper's ""go online every 4 months"" rule only applies if you care about cryptoeconomic security; if you're willing to trust honest majority models including an honest majority in every past validator set (ie. that people won't sell their private keys after they move their coins elsewhere) then this kind of heuristic could be applied to Casper as well.",2018-04-27 06:12:00

The cost of electricity is perhaps paradoxically one of the few things tethering cryptos to real-world fiat costs and helping to keep the price from plummeting.

Then again, ""cryptos"" like XRP have no such costs, and they seem to do fine.

30,dy1ytzj,"Thanks sharing -u-ethereumcharles, and for engaging with the Ethereum community! I am an Ethereum researcher and have started digging into Cardano in the last few days. You seem to have a solid team of researchers and to be making genuine progress at a relatively fast pace. I'm excited to learn more and engage more with your researchers.

One of your researchers, Bernado David, was especially approachable by email which lead to [this](https:--ethresear.ch-t-fork-free-randao-1835). In general a great place to post Cardano research (or any blockchain-y research) is https:--ethresear.ch. This is where a lot of the Ethereum research happens, and it happens in public. The forum is open to all and you'll generally get feedback quickly. On this note, the closest Cardano equivalent I could find is https:--forum.cardano.org. Given the research emphasis Cardano has, I was surprised that there isn't a ""Research"" tag on this forum (the closest I could find is ""Developers"").

I have watched several of your talks, and I understand transparency is a core part of Cardano culture. I don't have a link readily available, but I remember you saying something along the lines of ""Cardano prides itself in doing research totally in the open"". This aligns quite well with the way we do research at Ethereum.

I understand that Ouroboros Genesis was the fruit of 7 months of research. Where could I have followed the Ouroboros Genesis research as it was happening (i.e. before the polished paper was shipped) during those 7 months? I believe you are now doing research on Ouroboros Hydra and I'm very curious to follow along in real time (if possible!). I asked for [more details on Ouroboros Hydra](https:--forum.cardano.org-t-ouroboros-hydra-10881) on the Cardano forum and wasn't able to find much more info. Ouroboros Hydra is especially of interest to me because my main research topic is sharding.

I have many research questions I'd like to ask you. I'll ask a couple to get the ball rolling :)

1. We are currently looking at random beacons. I understand the Ouroboros team has looked into those in detail, changing design at least twice (in the original Ouroboros you were using Schoenmakers, then moved to SCRAPE, and then changed again in Ouroboros Praos to something closer to Algorand). Vitalik argues [in this post](https:--ethresear.ch-t-rng-exploitability-analysis-assuming-pure-randao-based-main-chain-1825) that a RANDAO approach may be good enough. As I mention [in my reply](https:--ethresear.ch-t-rng-exploitability-analysis-assuming-pure-randao-based-main-chain-1825-5?u=justindrake) I think it would be great to get external perspectives. Would you or one of your researchers mind commenting on this particular topic?
2. In your reply to Vitalik in this thread, you write ""In practice for the forward security part, there are numerous methods to enforce this"". You mention trusted hardware as one solution. What other solutions do you know of?",2018-04-27 19:33:00

496,dy85pq0,"This is a proof of concept of (part of) a fork choice rule-based mechanism for how sharding can be bolted on top of the current ethereum main chain, with a specialized random beacon and shard block times of <10 seconds. The basic idea is based on a concept of dependent fork choice rules. First, there is a proof of stake beacon chain (in phase 4, aka full casper, this will just be merged into the main chain), which is tied to the main chain; every beacon chain block must specify a recent main chain block, and that beacon chain block being part of the canonical chain is conditional on the referenced main chain block being part of the canonical main chain.

The beacon chain issues new blocks every ~2-8 seconds, with a design similar to the one prototyped [here](https:--twitter.com-VitalikButerin-status-760185856057638913) (implementation at https:--github.com-ethereum-research-tree-master-old_casper_poc3), using the RANDAO mechanism to generate randomness (see https:--ethresear.ch-t-rng-exploitability-analysis-assuming-pure-randao-based-main-chain-1825, https:--ethresear.ch-t-rng-exploitability-analysis-assuming-pure-randao-based-main-chain-1825-10 and http:--vitalik.ca-files-randomness.html for analysis), and its purpose is to be the ""heartbeat"" for the shard chains and to provide the randomness that determines who the proposers and notaries in the shard chains are. The beacon mechanism is upgraded with a [proof of activity](https:--eprint.iacr.org-2014-452.pdf)-inspired technique to increase its stability.

The shards then themselves have a dependent fork choice rule mechanism that ties into the beacon chain; every time a new beacon block is created, that beacon block randomly selects a proposer which has the right to create a shard collation. Each shard collation points to a parent collation on the same shard, and a beacon block.

Things that are not included in this test are:

* The mechanism for notaries to confirm shard collations (though this is trivial to implement; it's the same as for beacon blocks)
* The shard-to-main-chain crosslink (see https:--ethresear.ch-t-cross-links-between-main-chain-and-shards-1860) that ties the beacon and the shard chains back into the main chain
* The feature where all notarizations of any shard simultaneously double as votes in a global Casper FFG cycle, increasing Casper FFG scalability and allowing its min deposits and finality times to both be reduced (perhaps min deposits to 32 ETH and finality times to ~6 minutes)",2018-05-01 02:52:00

If the regulators don't see this evolve, they will likely make a decree forcing staking pools to become fiefdoms of the regulated banking industry.

One of the things I love most about Ethereum is how many of us will be able to participate in securing the network- both distributing that important responsibility, but also creating a sense of network ownership among ETH holders.

I believe this spirit of inclusivity and personal ownership in the network are big differentiators for Ethereum. I don't have to run an expensive campaign to run to become one of just 21 block producers (like in EOS). And in the future, I won't have to buy expensive mining equipment that immediately begins to depreciate. Instead, I can buy some ETH and either validate directly, or participate in a pool if I don't have the minimum ETH.

I write often on the topic of Ethereum's network effect, but this is just another way in which Ethereum will significantly enhance this effect among users - holders, providing us with direct incentive to responsibly secure the network. And by doing it this way, with potentially thousands of validators under full Casper - Sharding, Ethereum has no doubt chosen a harder path, but I believe that it will create a resilient network that no other project in the space can match.",2018-05-08 01:37:00

3,dyr1j0t,"Hey folks!

Looks like the [automoderator](http:--snew.github.io-r-ethereum-about-log) on this subreddit swallowed up a bunch of your questions that didn't get through (due to minimum karma requirements, etc.).

I managed to recover most of them, so if you didn't see your question, it's likely below.

My answers:

### Is the entire throughput of the Loom Network shared by all applications utilizing the Loom Network? In other words, is it possible for a single popular application to ""DDOS"" the entire Loom Network?

No, this is our concept of [application-specific sidechains](https:--medium.com-loom-network-million-user-dapps-on-ethereum-an-introduction-to-application-specific-sidechains-c0fdc288c5e5), which we later renamed to [DAppChains](https:--medium.com-loom-network-dappchains-scaling-ethereum-dapps-through-sidechains-f99e51fff447).

Essentially each DApp runs on its own sidechain with its own nodes & validators, so each DApp can optimize for its own decentralization - scalability needs.

### If a single application (e.g. cryptokitties), ""DDOS""es the Ethereum network, what impact would that have on Loom Network?

When you want to transfer assets on mainnet or otherwise interact with Ethereum smart contracts, Loom DAppChains are still bottlenecked by Ethereum's transaction throughput. Developers will have to keep this in mind in their design decisions for which parts of the DApp to run on mainnet, whether those actions require very fast confirmations or not.

Loom is just one aspect of scaling  other solutions like sharding are still quite necessary to scale the number of transactions on mainnet.

### Do you have any plans to build different types of DApps as examples so developers know what they can build on Loom Network? As currently it seems like mostly game DApps excluding Delegate.

Our initial focuses are on games and social apps, because those are 2 areas where we see the biggest demand from developers we've talked to.

You can build any type of DApp on Loom though, so we'd love to hear what other types of DApps you're looking to build!

### What sort of transaction rate would Loom Network allow for? 

All statistics are lies. Be very skeptical when a platform boasts how many transactions per second it can handle  in a closed setting with a single node on a supercomputer, even Ethereum can scale to millions of transactions per second.

We care more about real world results than boasting benchmarks. Right now we are running a multiplayer card game on top of a DAppChain, and it runs perfectltly fine. Each use-case is different depending on its needs so we don't publish specific numbers, but we're seeing speeds that are more than enough for most games.

### CryptoZombies is superb, but what struck me is that the UI goes hand in hand with the DAPP. Web3.js apps that use Bootstrap just aren't as compelling. So if graphic design is as important for a DAPP as any other digital game - what advice would you give aspiring DAPP developers who don't have the artistic resources or flair of the guys at Loom? And, how much do you invest in graphic design - cryptoZombies in particular?

If you want your app to gain wide-scale usage, UX - UI are at least as important as the underlying tech. If you don't have this skillset, partner with or hire someone who does  or start learning! 

### Since Loom Network seems that it will be a scaling solutions for games.. and since games need random numbers... do you guys provide a solution for RNG (oracles or any other solution)?

There's a few ways we can handle this. 1) We have a basic pseudo-random that the Validators can agree on, which is good enough for most cases not involving gambling. 2) We have a way for validators to privately talk to each other and agree on random seeds, without clients of the blockchain knowing. Useful for games of chance. 3) You could use an external oracle for the highest security, but that's not going to be the fastest method.

### Will Usage of Loom network sidechains be restricted to games and social apps, or also B2B apps will be allowed (for example supply chain tracking apps) ?

You can build anything on Loom  we're just focusing on games and social apps in the beginning because that's where we see the most potential for mainstream adoption.

### Will it be possible to send-receive arbitrarary information to-from Ethereum Mainnet. Not talking about ERC721 or any tokens but communication with some custom contracts?

Yep, you can have your DAppChains communicate with smart contracts on mainnet however you want to! Using mainnet for tokens with value that you then use to play games on the sidechain is one of the most immediately useful use-cases we came up with, but we're really interested to see what other developers come up with.",2018-05-10 20:23:00

Inflation is a measurement of price levels in the economy. Casper changes the rewards for mining blocks, and rewards is one particular input which may or may not lead to changes in price levels. (updated for clarity)

Creating a meaningful inflation measurement is partly art, partly economic science, sometimes intentional distortion (read up on CPI in the US).

2,dysi6dw,">Suppose you are dropped on an alien planet, and see two rival political factions. You observe faction A issuing veiled death threats, and faction B reaching out to mainstream society, while dancing and celebrating alpacas and unicorns. Which faction do you join?

Okay, first off, **why would you join either alien faction**, especially based on such spurious criteria? 

*If* I were going to join one of these factions, I'd need to hear more about what actually distinguishes the two, and if someone approached me and said ""Well faction A issues veiled death threats, and faction B reaches out to mainstream society, dances, and celebrates alpacas and unicorns,"" then I would immediately suspect that this person was attempting to engage in **card stacking** (a propaganda technique), and not accurately or fairly representing both factions. In such a scenario, I would actually probably go out of my way to find out what supporters of faction A had to say for themselves, because I would (correctly) suspect that I was receiving an extremely biased perspective from the alien that I first discussed the matter with.

Furthermore, if Kevin Pham's tweet that Vitalik is responding to is supposed to be the ""veiled death threat"" in question, then I have to point out: **that's not a veiled death threat, that's a valid vulnerability and attack vector being pointed out**. 

[As Satoshi brilliantly pointed out within a week of announcing Bitcoin](http:--www.metzdowd.com-pipermail-cryptography-2008-November-014823.html): 

>>[Lengthy exposition of vulnerability of a systm to use-of-force
>monopolies ellided.]

>>You will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography.

>Yes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.

>**Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled network**s like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own. 

The entire point, the raison d'Ãªtre for cryptocurrency and blockchains, is to avoid such pitfalls and drawbacks of centralization. When someone tries to reiterate this point, trying to distract from their point with hypotheticals about being ""dropped on an alien planet"" and having to choose between political factions based on dancing, llamas, and unicorns is *not* a valid counterargument. Misconstruing the person's argument as a ""veiled death threat"" is a blatant strawman, and Vitalik's response is a non sequitur.

Vitalik has made plenty of intelligent arguments before. This is **not** one of them.",2018-05-11 10:57:00

Yes, I understand that Casper FFG makes it possible to have high security with a lower issuance. However, I think issuance has benefits other than just security. 

Mining is what gets many people into Ethereum. Mining is a great way for average investors to acquire Ethereum because it's less risky than buying. It also produces a very strong network effect because miners will introduce others to Ethereum.

Reducing the issuance by 80% will make mining unprofitable for almost everyone who is currently mining. This will effectively eliminate one of the most popular ways for newcomers to enter the Ethereum community.

Lets assume a system of 1 000 000 voters, and say 30 000 000 votes, with 1 vote == 1 token and 2 votes == 4 tokens. For a 51% attack, you would need to buy 15 000 000 votes, which would cost an individual 2,25\*10^14 tokens, or 2 individuals 5,625\*10^13 tokens. If one individual can rouse 10 000 puppets, they would spend 2,25\*10^10 tokens. If you can rouse 30 000 puppets, that would be 7,5 billion. This starts to approach manageable financial costs, at not unimaginable numbers of puppets. 

Assuming we need to keep tokens available to low enough cost for everyone, including minorities like the destitute, the homeless, or the oppressed, you are going to have to make the cost of a single vote low, as do the total number of votes to be cast.

Instead, I would much rather see forced transparency in all things run by the government. A complete, untamperable, evolving-over-time overview of all costs made by the government, and all income collected via any means. This would be required for any politician active now, and for at least 15 years afterwards.

This guy was a normal person, talked to him in Iquitos before he went in the jungle. He goes in for a two week retreat and comes out. He immediately signed up for another cheaper retreat, when he came back from that one, he had a green tattoo all over his face and arms, paraded around town in a hunting vest, with no undershirt,  and get this....I saw him almost every day like this, the guy never wore shoes. He'd walk around Iquitos like that. Wouldn't make eye contact for a simple greeting. My guess is that the shaman who brewed his batch included Toe, a known super hallucinogenic plant that is rarely included in Ayahuasca. I have consumed two different kinds of Ayahuasca. The first brew was decent but when I helped the villagers unload a boat full of school stuff, the top shaman asked me to drink from a different brew. When I drank that, I can tell you there has been no experience in my life to match it. It was an awakening of consciousness, I carry a stillness from that ceremony to this day. I will eventually learn how to conconct the superbrew, keep the recipe in my family, pass it down through disciplic succession...

Personally, I don't think Microsoft owning Github will have any impact on Ethereum developers-development.

Unless Github's user agreement is changed to grant Microsoft total ownership of all code published to the platform, OSS projects will be pretty safe.

I do think that its best for the ecosystem to have code-issues-releases spread across multiple providers to ensure that Ethereum development-patch releases aren't blocked due to a single-provider outage.

This purchase makes no strategic sense for MS, though. Github has no moat, no sustainable business model. Gitlab and similar services are going to eat their lunch. Why not buy Gitlab instead? Or just run a Gitlab service themselves? And why does the MS ecosystem need a specialized git service provider? Why doesn't Ethereum just run its own Gitlab service? (I'm not volunteering.)

Ethereum has nothing to worry about, at least for its public repositories. Git is distributed. If MS behaves, it's a single command for each checkout to switch to a different service provider.

2,e01p2n2,"How would microsoft owning Github make it less neutral?

Microsoft is a big corporation. It does not directly care about the products or the users, instead it cares about the profits and shareholders. I'm not saying that this is bad, of course they still try to have good products and happy users, but don't be fooled by thinking that good software or happy users is the actual goal. The software and services are just a tool to accomplish their actual goal which is to maximize their profits.

With that in mind, you should realize that if Microsoft would own Github, the goal would not be to maximize the profits of Github anymore, but to maximize the profits of Microsoft instead. Maybe they will try to make C# a more preferred language, which would lure people into using Windows and make Windows the comfort zone for many computer users.

The reason C++ exists, is because good developers collectively want to have a good low level platform to compile high performance software, from which we literally all benefit. The reason C# exists is to make more people use and pay for the Microsoft ecosystem.

I hope you and everybody else realizes how truly sad it would be for anyone, if we would lose the neutrality of a great platform like Github.",2018-06-04 00:39:00

The easy answer is ""not very"" of course, given the big lead the ethereum has as the parent chain as well as its versatility. Nevertheless, if a dApp ever truly clicks with the mainstream I wouldn't put it outside of the range of possibility.

They talked about things like how it can be used for drugs (really still this?), how speculators are making millions on it (like why even mention this?), how the market recently crashed (so what, it's crashed hundreds of times and will crash hundreds more), and how bitcoin has a really low t-s compared to visa (there are plans to massively increase this speed).",2018-06-07 00:09:00

103,e0blb3m,"This is bound to be confusing to many people - Vitalik is describing ""Casper and Sharding"" in this video. This is staking with 32 Ether that will occur AFTER Sharding has been launched in the Constantinople (second part of Metropolis) update that will occur some time AFTER late 2019, when Casper FFG (Friendly Finality Gadget) has run its course. Casper FFG is the first PoS system that could start as early as August 2018 and requires a minimum of 1500 ether to stake. 

It would be a mistake to watch this video and develop an understanding that staking with 32 Ether is going to happen very soon. Staking with 32 Eth is second-stage staking.

Now, I could be confused. Vitalik has discussed [Two-Speed Casper FFG](https:--ethresear.ch-t-two-speed-casper-ffg-2084) which does include PoS validators with 32 ether, presumably after sharding has launched but BEFORE Casper CBC. Casper CBC (Correct By Construction) is Vlad's Casper, and it won't launch until after 2020.

Here is my timeline with fake estimates because I don't represent the Ethereum Foundation and I'm allowed to make shit up and [if the internet works like it's supposed to, you'll correct me](https:--xkcd.com-386-).

**First:** Casper FFG deploys, PoS validators begin staking with 1500 Ether.

**Second:** Sharding deploys along with the Metropolis hardfork. Two-Speed casper (if it goes through) begins,  and staking with 32 ether becomes possible.

**Third:** Casper FFG contract is depleted, PoW rewards fall to 0, Casper CBC (full PoS) begins. Staking continues with 32 eth with full PoS, sharding, and plasma enabling something like 150,000 transactions per second*, [you should watch this go game](https:--www.youtube.com-watch?v=qD-IbiVpcT8).

\*The 150,000 figure is calculated as: 150,000 tps = (15 current tps) * (100 fold increase through sharding) * (100 fold increase through plasma). These figures are in the [OmiseGo ""go game"" video](https:--youtu.be-qD-IbiVpcT8?t=2m), where Vitalik says (paraphrased) ""... the implementation of plasma and sharding will give you a 10,000x scalability gain..."" over the current 15 transactions per second currently possible.",2018-06-08 19:38:00
40,e0bmel6,"Wow the details have changed significantly since the last talked of his I've seen and from the latest info on ethresear.ch (which I think is positive and exciting)

- Validators are now assigned to shards for an hour. I wonder what the thinking is for this, since that's a long time, but still not long enough to fully validate the shard history, I would think.
- The way he is using the word ""beacon"" suggests to me that the current ethereum main chain is essentially being wholesale replaced by a different main chain with a different architecture (which is reasonable to do, but messy) clearly the idea of an SMC on the ""old chain"" is being downplayed.
- There is finally a robust mechanism being described for block proposing without POW, pretty much along the lines of how I thought it would work, but which was never spelled out anywhere (i.e. a committee of stakers are assigned long term to a shard to act as proposers)
- The idea that large stakers are assigned more shards is interesting and not something I've heard him say before, definitely makes sense.

As someone who follows this stuff closely as a hobby, this is a super exciting presentation, because the design described has a lot less ""hand waving"" than previous talks but is extremely ambitious, since it describes a fully sharded, fast block time, 100% POS ethereum.

1,e1txa0r,"I don't get why it seems so difficult for people. It just needs some pruning to separate the transactions from the balance. Data other than balance are metadata and shouldn't be at the same location as the balance that needs to be secured. If people want specific metadata to also be secured, they can use a specific chain for it. 

With these settings, a pruned balance block is equivalent to all its previous transaction blocks, thus considerably reducing the data storage needs down to a level completely depending on the number of transactions per seconds and the transaction history we want to keep (rather than depending on some awkward date of origin). That is, once we use PoS: grouping updates onto one fork would probably be preferable. 

So, yes, just like the current average gas price to get a transaction onto the next block, the data size of the entire blockchain is of matter. But there are solutions. ",2018-07-05 21:42:00

99,e1wa0y3,"The problem here is not that there are web-based or centralized exchanges. As was pointed out [here](https:--bitcoinfoundation.org-forum-index.php?-topic-1392-a-worthwhile-revival-of-an-old-topic-warnings-to-users-about-exchanges-&tab=comments#comment-14617), the real problem is the (lack of) privacy and security associated with most web-based and centralized exchanges, the failure of many in the industry to secure themselves and the exchange platforms and services they offer to others against theft, and the mistaken perception that we can treat any exchange as a wallet.

Binance is just one of the latest and most classic examples of fake volume on an exchange coupled with repeated security failures. OTOH, Kraken has held up under persistent threats for the duration of the existence of the crypto exchange industry, and should be considered to be an example of how stuff gets done well, but many exchanges sacrifice any semblance of security for an abundance of convenience instead. And the reason why there isn't as much volume as there could be in a true decentralized exchange like Bisq (formerly Bitsquare) is not just its fees, it is because people would rather complain about exchange performance rather than participate and write code to make it better.

Then there are the recent proliferation of so-called ""decentralized exchanges"" which aren't really at all. In this group you can find a slew of much-hyped ""DEXs"" which are based on Ethereum and which require you to ""sign up"" and ""log in"" to ""get access"" to the service which the exchange developers' vaunted skills have generated. Typically however these are just more knockoffs with minimal security, parading and posturing as a decentralized exchange when they are not.

6,e22vn0s,"I've seen a disturbing trend where all value is still always expressed in dollars... This trend started sometime early last year and continues. Instead of quoting how much bitcoin or eth is actually being discussed we see arbitrary dollar values instead.


This is problematic for several reasons. One is that without the actual amount of crypto being discussed we don't really know true supply numbers. The dollar value changes constantly. Another reason is that 2 billion in bitcoin isn't 2 billion dollars, it's about 300k bitcoin. Crypto isn't so liquid you can equate the two. 


The final reason is that it reveals the currency people really want, which is USD. In an attempt to over throw bitcoin as a reserve currency of the crypto world, everyone started using USD as the price for all shitcoins. This has been extremely useful for arb bots that use tether (USDT) to suck the liquidity away from bitcoin and prevent any other crypto coin from increasing liquidity on crypto-crypto trading pairs.

Some of us old timers had dreams of an actually using the currency part of crypto-currency. The obsession with the USD price is a psychological force which is highly influencial in how this space develops.

- Anyone can create a PM -> platform doesn't rely on central team creating sports-politics markets (categories that have permission from some governments). You can create a market about anything you want the community to predict by staking money.
- Market settlement relies on Augur's oracle, a decentralized human oracle incentivized to report on the true outcome of a market-event.

76,e2vtpmo,"Team JUST reported this to you directly when the exploit was found in the running game Peter. Outlining clearly that the Ethereum documentation and responses by the ETH team-spokespersons show that this exploit should never exist in the first place.  

When you were alerted to it you gave this response.
https:--i.imgur.com-a7Z6Akc.png

Where as the official public stance on this exploit states it cannot happen, as seen here from a moderator of ETH on stackexchange. Who provides consistent and clear answers to many solidity questions for millions of developers.
https:--ethereum.stackexchange.com-questions-14015-using-evm-assembly-to-get-the-address-code-size

Team just was very disheartened to receive such a dismissal of an exploit-communication failure of this size. The most readily available documentation for solidity, and the EVM is ... at best difficult to navigate for information like this. With all surface level information for this exploit clearly and visibly directing anyone trying to learn the content towards this type of attack not being possible at all.

&nbsp;

The tweet you linked (that we have since deleted) was a community moderator that spoke poorly on the subject. We have a very skilled set of solidity developers as evidenced by our content, but we are, as all developers constantly learning about the beautiful creation that is ethereum and the intricate problems we must protect against.

&nbsp;

I don't really know what the community is going to think about the fact that you have had this exploit submitted directly to you by Team JUST directly, and then turned around and created social media-reddit posts to attack the very developer that submitted it to you, by claiming that you have figured out how to exploit it.

&nbsp;


We already told you how to exploit it, in fact, we already told our community how to exploit it. There's a full contract toy we created weeks ago when it was discovered in our live game that lets anyone in our community roll for a chance at the airdrops. We figured if it was broken why not let everyone play with it.

Anyone can attempt to roll for airdrops (At about a 10-50x higher chance than normal) with our contract.
https:--inventor-tech.github.io-GohanMode-1337.html
It's pretty much free eth, have fun, 
(you do need a registered name for our game first though).",2018-07-23 21:34:00
11,e2vv2mj,">Their attack code is not really available, but looking through a successful transaction you can see that they have a more elaborate pwner code: they try to deploy a new contract, but if the address is not a winner (per the evaluation of \`airdrop()\`, they don't revert, rather keep creating nested contracts until one succeeds). GG!

The cool thing is that since contract addresses are deterministically created, you don't need to actually create N contract until a correct one is found, you can just iterate within your constructor until you find one that has a winning address.

It's actually pretty cheap, so you can easily calculate if exploit is worth it, just need something like ;

    -- Sender address for a given contract instance
    address newSender = address(this);
    
    -- Number of contracts that needs to be deployed
    uint256 nContracts = 0;
    
    -- Iterate until one of the child contract has a winning address 
    while ( !isWinningAddress(newSender) ) {
      newSender = address( keccak256(0xd6, 0x94, newSender, 0x01) );
      nContracts ++;
    }
    
    -- If number of contracts to be created makes it worth it, exploit
    if ( costToExploit(nContracts) < fomo3d.airDropPot()) {
      exploit(nContracts);
    } else {
      revert('Exploit not worth it')
    }

Note that such an attack could've been prevented by requesting sender to provide an ECDSA signature or with a two steps process requiring the same sender to send two transactions (in addition to the `isHumanOrContractConstructor` modifier). ",2018-07-23 21:58:00

13,e2vw7sr,"Relevant article:

>This can be done by ensuring that the caller of Token.buyTokens also submits an ECDSA signature which can be checked by ecrecover. This 100% prevents a smart contract from participating since smart contracts can never have private keys, hence they cannot sign. NOTE: Do not use the EXTCODESIZE check to prevent smart contracts from calling a function. This is not foolproof, it can be subverted by a constructor call, due to the fact that while the constructor is running, EXTCODESIZE for that address returns 0.

EDIT : Thanks to downvote me so hard... but my post was only about SpectroCoin gift cards (vouchers as a withdrawal option).   
I don't talk (and I don't know, and I don't use and I don't endorse and I didn't participate) in Bankera ICO, SpectroCoin debit cards, exchange for trading cryptos...

98,e2xveb3,"Misleading title, you can buy Amazon giftcards with ETH, then use the giftcards. Giftcard reseller fraud is a massive problem across all platforms, since anyone can copy a code, sell it, then apply it to their own account (hey maybe we need provably scarce giftcard tokens, get on it ETH devs), so I don't think I'll be buying giftcards with crypto any time soon.

Purse.IO is currently the best in the game as far as I can tell, letting you buy things off Amazon directly using BTC and BCH, rather than buying a giftcard first. You also get a hefty discount (e.g. 15-20% off) in the process. Would be a great thing if they started accepting other top cryptos like ETH, LTC, XRP, whatever.",2018-07-24 20:21:00

Just wanted to clarify. This is a new release which allows ETH users to pay natively through web3-metamask, the whole process the Ethereum way. Check out the tweet here: [https:--twitter.com-bitrefill-status-1021799852282466305](https:--twitter.com-bitrefill-status-1021799852282466305) 

Re the cards: We're not reselling P2P used cards but official cards bought from Amazon. So zero risk of having any problems with redeeming them etc, but then again we don't have any particular discounts. The US cards cost $100 for $100, the EUR cards are currently somewhat more expensive (working on that).

I guess they probably have a bunch of prepared abstract micro-services that spawn->register->work->self-distruct on demand.

1,e41xo3o,"Setting up passwords: Having everyone register their: SSN; 2 forms of Identification or a passport; proof of residency; email; phone number, online or at the DMV. Each person will receive a wallet address, their personal chosen password with a forced high standard of security and instructions on how to set up their wallets.

Voting: considering that most elections contain multiple catagories, it's possible to issue multiple blockchains (and tokens) for each catagory based on district, nodes can be based in districts and states to confirm the transactional votes. Every new election the blockchains fork in order to invalidate any unused votes. 

Security: the truly only unsecured thing that can come from these blockchain based voting systems is regarding the idea of decentralization. It is possible that when creating this system, the central entity could make more coins than they promised. But this would be obvious in a public blockchain as a wallet would show having more than one catagory token and authorities would be able to locate the wallet because their ssns would be connected to the wallet. If they made multiple wallets not connected to ssn then the nodes can then consider it an invalid transaction and block it from the network. As long as there is a working consensus with multiple nodes in every district there shouldn't be any chance of a hack or ddos or whales controlling the votes.

I have a slim understanding of blockchain, as do all of us but bitcoin has never been hacked. The only fear would be from corruption and manipulation behind the cloth but that does happen currently and is less obviously than what a public blockchain could provide. ",2018-08-12 18:15:00

I'm definitely getting a nostalgic feel from early internet days. People can knock this all they want but you're helping build the future. I only fear that we may be heading towards the EA-ification of the internet where monetizing participation results in microtransactions ruling access and behaviors. In such an environment, those with the most crypto have the most freedom in cyberspace, and isn't that the antithesis of the goal? Not saying your project enables that, just making the comment.

Since the majority of people went with ETH, it¨¹s the new ¨¹main road¨¹. ETC is still there, but it¨¹s considered a secondary road now.

This new change is likely to become the new main road. But if it it doesn¨¹t, then the previous main road is still available.

I think digital indentity is KEY to having a successful blockchain & one of the biggest reasons I believe this is because blockchains get spammed with transactions.

Wondering why Ethereum is losing value?
u-AfricanMonkeyGod
Are you wondering why Ethereum is losing value? This is because mass conciousness learns slower than individual conciousness.

What people are learning is the impact ASIC miners have on an already centralized coin. Didnt know this coin was already centralized? Did you know that Ethereum Classic is the original Ethereum and the founders of ETC forked the blockchain to the new Ethereum and the majority of the community switched over? (It even kept the name)

That's right. The founders of Ethereum can change the protocol of the blockchain at any given time, making this as centralized as other coins like NEO.

The protocol of the blockchain is currently being changed by these founders to once again, benefit themselves. They are changing from PoW to PoS.

What does this mean? This means they are changing to an even more centralized cryptocurrency that ONLY benefits people who have a shit ton of ethereum (like the founders).

PoS is proof of stake and they are changing to it under the guise of becoming anti-asic which the founders said they didnt care about in early 2018. But now apparently they do, right around the time they are centralizing the coin by moving it to PoS.

What does this mean to the average Joe? This means you cant mine ethereum anymore. You can only buy it. And if you buy enough (the figure is really high) then you generate new Eth. So the people who will be generating the new Ethereum will be the ones who are holding the most Ethereum (the founders)

So since they possess the majority of existing ETH, then virtually ALL of the ethereum being generated in the future will be in their possession and they will sell it slowly to other people so they to can potentially have enough to generate new ETH.

This is by far the worst model for a cryptocurrency. The founders do the PoS to get people to buy more Ethereum from them (which gives the Ethereum they have more value). the incentive being you will make ""free"" ethereum by just holding a shit ton of ethereum. It tricks people into buying the centralized shit coin with the hope that they will get free money by just holding the coin.

Do you know what other crypto does this? NEO. Have you seen what has happened to the value of NEOs coin? $60 to $20 and now its stuck at $20... you notice what other coin is also have one of the worst declines? ETHEREUM.. because they are both centralized PoS coins with founders that are essentially the CEO of the coin. It completely defeats the purpose of crypto.

Remember at the start I said it takes the masses longer to learn than an individual. That is what is happening right now. That is what you are experiencing, a shift as people realize just how awful Ethereum truly is.

Monero will gain more attention in the close future. Why? they are anti-asic. If they ever change to PoS it will be a PoW-PoS hybrid. Also, the crypto is far more closer to anonymous than btc and ethereum. The cost is cheap to send monero and the speed is fast. This coin will start to gain more and more attention and value as people learn that the value of a coin lays within a blockchain, not in what the founders say they will or wont do in the future

Also, dapps are awful. Just another way to scam people.",2018-09-10 23:38:00

I don't think there is a great TL;DR on the project out there at the moment, but I hope my response to the ""Why use blockchain?"" post in here is a good start.

This is partially due to the fact that even though they are beginning testing with the first electricity customer this coming week and then starting testing with the Lattice1 hardware beta testers next month, lots of details have not yet been revealed. I imagine once they are closer to finalizing development before the full launch they will probably begin marketing and work on concise messaging. In the meantime, here's a list of resources regarding the project for those who want to dive in deeper:

- [Grid+ Homepage](https:--gridplus.io-)
- [Grid+ White Paper v2.3](https:--dorive.google.com-file-d-0Bz90riPGRHquNDVXVE81RmppaUk-view)
- [Grid+ Blog: In-depth Reads on Plasma, Hardware Wallet Tech, & More](https:--blog.gridplus.io)

- [Grid+ Community Telegram (Allows Exchange - Price Discussion)](https:--t.me-GRIDToken)
- [Grid+ Subreddit](https:--www.reddit.com-r-GridPlus-)

The blog is the best place for up to date and in-depth information. The white paper is still one of the best resources but parts of it have been deprecated due to changes made along the way (e.g. Plasma replaced the original sidechain idea and the BOLT stable token will likely be replaced with another stablecoin like the new Gemini offering in order to offload the regulatory and compliance burden.)",2018-09-14 00:11:00

43,e6096lx,"The reality is that small scale hobbyist miners are made up of those that hodl (effectively buying ETH with their electricity bills - like me) and some others that sell immediately (some sell to cover costs and keep the rest, some sell small portions, some sell it all etc). Conversely, large scale mining operations like BitMain and the other ASIC manufacturers dump their ETH straight away in order to generate as much profit as possible. By lowering the reward and not nerfing these ASICs, mining will become unprofitable for almost everyone except for hobbyist miners in areas with dirt cheap electricity, and the ASIC operations. This funnels a greater proportion (and likely total number, even accounting for the decreased block reward) to the dumpers, which adds unnecessary sell pressure which can easily be avoided. With increased sell pressure, comes a decreased price, and even fewer hobbyist miners able to continue, and even more ETH going to the dumpers, and the cycle continues. 

This could open the possibility for a 51% attack on the network, going to the largest ASIC farm. But this isnt whsn¨¹t what I¨¹m worried about - I¨¹m worried about the price never being able to recover because of consistently large sell orders every day. Why this isn¨¹t considered is beyond me - it¨¹s in everyone¨¹s interest. ",2018-09-15 13:03:00

Edit 11:42 am: so it seems to have normalized quite a bit, in the beginning the downvotes were much more harsh and it had at times 0 upvotes vs 180 views. Seems after it picks up it goes. Seems like a good strategy to nip something in the bud though if it doesn't manage to gain traction.

Edit 2: I've noticed every single comment of mine is flucauting like crazy, people have pmed me and told me that.

It's really funny if you ask me about these ASIC companies which are popping out left and right with these more efficient chipsets etc etc... so they always quote the mining power, then daily revenue... and then ROI... think about it, all of the listed specs except for power consumption and hash rate are just lies.

perform your POW once, and store it, then every block you submit your best answer thats stored, and now there is no more reason to mine endlessly sucking all that power, and there will be SO much spare storage capacity, it won't be worth people to invest in more storage capacity and create giant farms of miners, it will be the ""peoples"" method of getting a little using spare resources...

The ethash algorithm requires [64 random reads of 128 bytes](https:--github.com-ethereum-wiki-wiki-Ethash) to a ~4 GB dataset. That means a 1.4 GH-s device (as claimed in the article) would need a minimum of 11.5 TB-s of memory bandwidth. So far, the highest bandwidth memory interfaces capable of storing at least 4 GB have about 200 GB-s of bandwidth (e.g. [HBM2](https:--forums.anandtech.com-threads-gpu-memory-math-gddr6-vs-hbm2-vs-gddr5x-vs-aquabolt.2534513-) per RAM package, or about 400 GB-s per ASIC. (You can't fit a larger-than-1024-bit HBM2 bus onto a single ASIC.) In order to get 11.5 TB-s, this device would need around 30-60 independent memory systems, or around 120 GB of HBM2 RAM.

I would however be happy if the Eth Dev team decided to tweak the Ethash algo to inflate the memory usage for the DAG to about 7GB. I know it would render my GPU's useless for mining, but it would also render ALL the 4GB ASICs out there and the hidden 5GB ASIC chips also useless. An ideal change would be to use something like ProgPOW (Im sure vlad and vitalik can improve on it if they spent time thinking in that direction), and I know the ASICs can add memory in their next batch of miners but just ONE move like this states your intention of fighting off ASICs, and making that statement is very important. Right now they just rolled over and are playing dead.

A simple change like that would still bring the network back to being decentralized and in the hands of hobby miners, while the 7GB DAG would mean for most GPU's there is a 1GB buffer for the DAG to grow over time as Casper comes in (If it EVER comes in).",2018-09-19 13:39:00

Not a whole lot of other models to go off of right now, but the advantage of doing this is faster transactions with pretty much 0 transaction fees once tokens are sent over the bridge connecting the sidechain to mainnet.

You can list the token on permissionless 0x exchanges such as LedgerDex and BambooRelay, and if it gains a little traction ERC dEX and Bancor also have low bars to entry. Having your own token for the game also gives you more flexibility to apply in-game balancing and buff-nerfing in the future as you have more control over the token, rather than just working with eth, of which you have no control over it's price or supply.

> ICOs were the hype of 2017
and especially pushed the price of Ethereum

As I understand it, the first 6 months of 2018 had more ICO investments than all of 2017.

Tim Draper:
> I expect that since cryptocurrencies will increase the
velocity of money, the current $86 trillion global market for currency will grow to be about $140 trillion in the next 10 years

There is something funny here. A higher velocity means less money is needed, not more.

> A DApp is a collection of many smart contracts that are working together to create a product for users.

> To be a DApp, four criteria must be met. First, the
application must be open-source

I don't agree. However, there are advantages to the user if it is open source, as it makes it possible to prove behavior.

> Third, the application must have a token associated
with it

Does it, really? Though it is very common.

> The solution that the Ethereum foundation came up with [to the DAO hack] was highly controversial. They implemented a hard fork by releasing a new version of
the Ethereum software client that did not include the hacked transactions. They rewinded the Ethereum blockchain in order to remove the hackers transactions.

This his is incorrect, isn't it? The ""stolen"" ether were moved to a new account. There was no rewind of the blockchain, which would have reverted everything, not just TheDAO transactions

Network effect:
> For example,
assume the social media network Pinterest has n users, then the utility each
user derives from the network is proportional to (n ¨¹ 1), namely the
number of potential connections in the network. This relationship between
utility and users is the so-called network effect. If an additional user joins the
network, it increases the utility of the others, and assuming that all connections are.
equally valuable, the total network value should result proportional to n*(n ¨¹ 1),
which in turn is asymptotically proportional to nÂ²

There is a flaw in this analysis. The basic assumption is that ""the utility each
user derives from the network is proportional to (n ¨¹ 1)"". But that no longer holds when a blockchain is saturated (full blocks). This will mainly have an effect on the ""Payment system network effect"" described in the article.",2018-10-05 20:02:00

6,e7i0bni,"I actually am a game dev and got pretty far in a project like this but never finished it. Basically it would have been an online battle arena where you win money, but I couldnt see myself finishing it because its impossible to secure such a platform, either on the contract or the server. I thought about yielding to the chaos much in the manner of Minecraft 2B2T but didnt want to be destroyed by it myself. I wanted to make a decentralized MM system but I already had a centralized server for this which was both cheaper and easier on Heroku. I wanted to use something like data channels but the same point applies, and there are no such things as of yet. Basically its a solution to a problem that doesnt exist. If there is enough demand for it, and I can guarantee security for my own sake, Ill publish the game.

The only other purpose Im highly interested in is P2P networking but its too expensive to use gas for this. Maybe in the future the game can automatically collect ad revenue for gas money enough to open a WebRTC connection between clients. I gravitate toward P2P because of being a solo indie dev and not wanting to run a server. You would need to invent an architecture whcture where EACH client is server authority like proxy for another peer to ensure the game is secure. That would be awesome, but 20x harder",2018-10-10 14:41:00
5,e7i1g50,"> ...the average gamer shouldnt need to be an expert in using a wallet or making their first trade on an exchange to start interacting with smart contracts. The blockchain features should be abstracted away and used to create useful features that gamers appreciate while not inhibiting fun and usability. 

100% hit the nail on the head. 

There's a divide between cryptocurrency enthusiasts and gamers currently. The crypto-side is generally pretty willing to participate in games, but the traditional gaming community has an aversion to cryptocurrencies because they either think a game is a) selling out when it introduces elements of tokenisation, or b) trying to extract every last cent from the gamer. It's just the nature of crypto at the moment, but really there are awesome companies out there who ARE gamers and are looking to shapeshift the future of how devs-publishers create games, and how they look to engage their current and future players. Not only that, they want to appeal to a potential new segment of users who are coming from a puurely crypto-standpoint. 

Trying to find the way to cross them over WITHOUT scaring either side is imperative and it will all stem from creating a worthy gaming experience that works to create a rich world that perhaps satisfies the crypto-traders dream, while giving the adventurer the ability to collect treasures that they will truly own for the entirety of their gaming careers. 

To be able to look back through your vault of heirlooms and see *your* Arcanite Reaper once WoW has shut down (please Blizz don't take WoW away from me), or to have *your* Tricera Ops skin from your days of just-build-lolling over noskins is the same as when your parents open their photo album and show you parts of their history, things that truly meant something *to them*. These items deserve to be owned by you, because you've spent so much time earning them. When VR is beyond real, Ready Player One style, then it'll be a given that you must own these things. Was OASIS siloed in GSS' servers? I can't remember, but imagine spending all that time in what is essentially your primary world and then not owning your treasures. No thanks.

Chris, you nailed this article. Here's to the future of gaming and the future of this incredible technology that we are all damn lucky to be a part of. 

Cheers!

One thing that has been made clear, over and over, is that Bitcoin is NOT a scam! If Bitcoin is not a scam, what is his intention here? To explore ways to SCAM others? First it starts small, by holding two conceptions within his mind without binary judgement, but then it expands to: who knows where this ends, but probably child porn.

I can not say that Andreas will never dabble with the dark nature of the universe in his uncertain future. The world is a DANGEROUS place!

But the important thing to keep in mind here is to STICK WITH WHAT YOU KNOW, AND WHAT OTHERS HAVE VERIFIED. The tree of knowledge was off-limits for a reason. First it starts with a little bit of complex thought, and then you question the great creator himself for making the butthole a pleasure center.

Bitcoin was made for a reason. Intelligently designed to be perfect. Sometimes problems arise, but that is Satoshi testing you. Tricks, put there intentionally, to cast doubts among the unworthy.

Andreas, I am not sure if I can call you a human after today. When I hold your bust above the fire on occasion I see a hero, and in another instance, the shadows of a beast.

According to [their description](https:--www.csc-game.com-game) it's a space-based massively multiplayer online game that involves exploring space, mining resources, crafting items, and then exchanging those items (both ERC721 and ERC20 have been implemented). From their description:

>CSC starts players off in the home star system of Sol as newly-recruited commanders of the Galactic Federation. As commander of your very own starship, youll undertake missions, discover resources, and regularly acquire new skills in your quest to dominate the galactic frontier. Players can travel in a 50 light year radius from Sol to over 900 different star systems, mirroring our corner of the Milky Way. Each system is rich with its own resources and planets, some of which may contain hidden loot or technology blueprints.  
>  
>Players can own an unlimited amount starships in their fleet, but only one can be commanded at a time. Each starship can be modified by equipping various modules, such as upgraded weapons or shields. Each starship class provides a boost or buff to a distinct specialization, making some ships better suited for specific tasks. Modules can be acquired from other players in a systems trading post or crafted using harvested resources. As the player base grows and players continue to mine new resources and craft them into modules, ships, and other items, the growth of the economy gradually shifts from the Galactic Federation into the playeyers hands.  
>  
>Space in CSC will be divided into two regions: Core Space and Fringe Space. Core Space allows players to explore with relative safety and will have limited PvP (Player vs Player) interaction. While Core Space offers players a safe zone for research and exploration, certain resources may be much more difficult to find. Fringe Space is akin to the wild west where laws are merely suggestions, and players are at the mercy of local player-controlled governments. Fringe Space makes up most of the explorable universe, but its much more dangerous than Core Space. Those brave enough to traverse deep into Fringe Space will find abundant and rare resources, higher bounties, and more lucrative quests.  
>  
>Initial resource markets established in both Core and Fringe Space will be supplied by the Galactic Federation (GFI). As the player base grows, the GFI will reduce its production, allowing the community to take over and manage Core and Fringe economies. Players will transact in ETHER, the base currenency and primary medium of exchange of the entire Federation.

&#x200B;

Although I don't fully understand the technical side of Ethereum and blockchain technology, I understand well enough to see how much of a disruptor this technology truly is.  However, the full utility of Ethereum will not be used to its maximum potential until decision makers in public-facing companies understand and embrace it and begin implementing it within their own organizations - that's when full utilization will start moving forward.

&#x200B;

I understand the need-desire to focus almost entirely on the technical side of the business (and let's not fool ourselves, this is a business), however, until there's more adoption, we'll continue to sit here and wonder, ""When will this take off?""  

&#x200B;

The problem is that there isn't enough front end support - there's not enough analysis around use-cases and implementation within public facing organizations that demonstrate the power of Ethereum.  We need more business users involved, more business cases, more implementation teams, that treat Ethereum more like a SAAS in terms of roll-out and customer adoption rather than some obscure technology that's too far out there for most executives to understand.

&#x200B;

Good design is all about **identifying** and solving problems. I agree with the general sentiment of this post, but Id argue the industry lacks not only designers, but solid product folks in general.

The best products out there are simple and solve universal problems. This is not through purely UI or easy to use interfaces. What Im talking about here is identifying solid use cases for things that solve actual problems or that add value in some way.

I think the industry at large is looking at all of this backwards. I see thousands of dApps starting with blockchain and trying to come up with a good dApp rather than thinking of the **problem** or use cases first, **then** seeing IF it even makes any sense on a blockchain.

We not only need solid designers, we need researchers to help uncover unmet needs, product managers to help scope and phase out development (Coinbase has done this exceptionally well at this) as well as engineers.

I find the crypto space very interesting. 

But my first issue is that I dont know enough about crypto tech. I read a lot and the crypto space jargon is insanely difficult to parse. 

This tells me that there isnt enough articulation yet in terms of the specific use cases blockchain can solve. So its both a product development and a design issue. 

And second is that Im not young enough to take the risk of being compensated solely on crypto - especially at my salary level. 

Ive also only been approached by one recruiter for a crypto company in the last year. And I get about 1 recruiter message a week.

I've recently joined Scatter (a digital signature provider and wallet for EOS, Eth, and Tron) and am in the middle of doing a **public design review** which will help us revamp our UI and UX. There is a huge problem in the crypto space where a lot of developers are involved, but not so many designers and product specialists. This will change with time, but in the meantime it is holding us back. Things are harder to use than they have to be.

If you are interested in what I've been doing, you can check out my two articles on Medium where I talk about what I've been redesigning.

Or he could tell him the truth that we don't need banks and that they have created crippling debt by inflating assets far beyond what they would ever be with sound money so that everything costs 100x as much as it should and all of that excess belongs to the funny-money lenders.

1,e9mtqn2,"Neat idea! Thanks for sharing. However if I understand how this works correctly, I'm concerned about the scalability of putting all links on chain. That would seem to have the potential to put a lot of strain on the Ethereum network and a lot of ""bloat"" into the blockchain.

What if, instead, you had a system that was like:

ENS name -> address file hash -> content addresses

So users could subscribe to feeds based on their ENS names, then use the ENS name to fetch an address file hash (which is the only link stored on chain), and use IPFS or Swarm to fetch the address file which would then give the user a list of all the addresses to the content published by the creator.

This has the benefit of only storing one link per creator on-chain. A downside is that because the link is hash-addressed, you have to update the link each time you update the address file, putting additional load on the blockchain.

However, you can also offer a second option for resolving the address file which is to make it a mutable link (using either IPNS or good old HTTP) so that you can update the addresses in the address file without changing the address file link (and doing a blockchain tx) each time a content address is added.

Just an idea! What do you think?",2018-11-14 03:12:00

¨¹

A content creator publishes a piece of content online (e.g. Youtube, Torrent, etc.)

In other words, when you create a system in which those who amass a large fortune early on will permanently retain an unassailable advantage, you can never achieve anything that actually facilitates equality.  In fact, Ethereum's current path is even worse: not only do they retain a permanent advantage, that advantage is designed to increase with time.  The combination of staking and fees means wealth inevitably flows from the poor to the wealth, because that's the way the system is designed.

So no, Ethereum will not become the future of the internet, because it does not offer an improvement on the current economic model, and thus cannot gain an advantage over it in the long run.

A few things were not addressed and the most important imho: 

Instead of discussing if-when ethereum will ""recover"", we should just adopt it and **stop comparing it to fiat in terms of tangible value.** Most crypto currencies hold a much more tangible value than fiat and the fluctuations are actually market driven desperation from the fiat side of the balance, since they hold no direct equivalence to something that's real, while projects like ethereum can determine their value based on the work the token itself can achieve. **That's** the revolution, not the speculation crap that's still the driving factor behind a huge part of the community.

Blockchain as a concept will overtake the older and outdated systems, that's just a fact. But if we don't stay together and focus on making it happening in a way that empowers the people, there's a huge chance that the tech will just change what's considered money, but the adopted solution will be controlled by the same old guys who have always been in control anyway.

So, I think a little bit centralization might be good on the development side. After all, no one can control your coins other than you. If you don't like where the project is going, you can just sell your coins. Centralization of mining however, can be far more dangerous.

I think Satoshi's assumption was ""miners = holders"". Currently, miners don't hold majority of the coins, therefore they can't enforce the rules they want. They are simply controlled by the market price. Maybe, PoS can solve the governance problem, since stakers are also the coin holders.

To quickly give a plausible explanation for everything that you posted:

1) Vitalik advocating for decentralization is a good thing. You've twisted it around to mirror a past situation that is completely different.

2) Honestly I have no opinion on the issuance increase or decrease, everyone's goal is to get it to a level where the system is sustainable. Inflation is good as it prevents hoarding. I'm deferring to the experts on this one.

3) As another commenter mentioned, changing the issuance is a big deal as it can't truly be tested and replicated on a testnet because it deals with real world things like economics and profitability. It shouldn't be done haphazardly.

4) The hard fork was delayed as they didn't feel 100% confident about it and had DevCon and holidays coming up, they took a cautious approach and the HF is scheduled for January, no big deal.

5) Do you honestly feel that the ETH devs and co are not trying their hardest to make the best protocol and ecosystem possible? Did you not watch DevCon talks? Eth 2.0, Casper, Plasma, MetaMask mobile wallet-dapp store? They postponed a little bit and are trying their best to do it as quickly and securely as possible, and you accuse them of malice? Wow

6) Yeah, there's a way that people much smarter than you or I have decided to incrementally roll out changes in the safest way possible, this has caused some lessons learned and changes to the spec along the way. This is normal to learn new information and change your opinion if you think it is truly what is best. Hell, on Twitter yesterday Vitalik was welcoming criticism on Casper CBC from Munab Ali so that he could make it as good as possible. That's a winning attitude.

7) I don't even know what ProgPoW is, so I'm not sure it's the centre of a conspiracy.

8) Uh ya, see my comment about the economics being complicated and essential for the network to function.

9) Broken promises? Who do these people think they are? They aren't doing shit but 'hodling' and profiting off of someone else's hard work. You should be grateful these people are doing this stuff and that you know about it. Hodling Eth is literally the easiest money I've ever made and I owe Vitalik and Satoshi and Gavin and everyone else for that. If users leave then fine, let the market decide, but don't blame the developers.

10) I didn't see the thread, and agree issuance should be able to be discussed here, however if the thread was mostly about price then it's normal that they removed it as there is enough meme-price talk going on at r-ethtrader, I'm sure you'd be welcome to discuss it there. ",2018-11-23 12:44:00

2. The degree of the issue, and the strength and endurance of opinions on this one are far far less than for the block size debate. The coin vote for example was not well publicized and I am acquaintances with plenty of people who didn't vote because they didn't know about the  vote or  simply didn't care that much to participate in what they saw as an unimportant vote.

3. Going to 1 ETH per block is a fairly radical change, and reducing rewards that far could significantly reduce the number of miners and the level of security of the network. Most people believed that issuance should have been reduced, but to what level is a complex question. Whereas with BTC, there are plenty of cryptos with larger blocksizes that are working fine, and Core used questionable decentralization metrics used to try to justify stagnation.

4. and

5. are the same. They never committed to zero by summer, and if they  did it would be a bad idea. There are costs associated with securing a network, and if issuance plus fees does not cover them, then security will weaken. By allowing the issuance to remain nonzero, they're not taking it on faith that fees will cover those security costs. In the long run, the devs do want as low issuance as possible while maintaining securing - and with Casper's improved properties over PoW, greater reductions in issuance will be possible.

6. This is just iteration along the path to a secure and stable Casper? Are you specifically criticising the work here or just being cantankerous and fearmongering?

7. Not up to date on this. Wouldn't mind seeing more ProgPOW discussion but will defer to experts.

8. This is mostly covered by other points here.

9. Crypto is volatile. ETH has suffered more than they could have otherwise, since lots of ICO fundraising dumps happened in ETH. Developer and ecosystem momentum is still #1 easily.

Frankly, many of them are very underpaid by the foundation and are working on ETH as a 'labor of love,' and because they believe it will change the world if and when throughput-UX issues get solved and it becomes widely adopted as a computing platform that lots of regular people actually use. 

Regarding issuance reduction, that's planned to occur with Constantinople where a bunch of other code is being deployed. I'm guessing the OP doesn't have a background in software development, or he would know that it's incredibly difficult to release bug-free code on the first pass of a software project. But that's exactly the conundrum Ethereum is faced with - it's absolutely imperative that the code which gets released has as few bugs as possible, ideally zero. A critical bug in the protocol code could mean the evaporation of billions of dollars of value and a loss of faith in the entire platform itself. This challenge means that deadlines often have to be pushed back until the developers are highly certain that the code is safe to release.

The EF truly believes in an ethos of decentralization. They have explicitly stated multiple times that they want to spend all the money the EF possesses, and then eventually disappear. I've had multiple conversations with the Ethereum Foundation's executive team, and they've repeatedly espoused this vision. Crypto is still early, and there might be other awesome layer 1 projects in the future that blow away everything which exists today, but for the time being ETH is the only project I know of whose leadership *actually believes* in decentralization.

Citation needed, and it needs to be much better than a coinvote that no one participated in where you could only use MEW-MyCrypto.  In fact, everyone I know was in favor of reducing to 2, and regardless, there should be a risk-aversion when it comes to issuance reduction.

> ETH: Issuance reduction requires changing one single line of code, but it's just too risky. Seemingly, more risky than creating from scratch completely new Ethereum 02.

The vision has always been that we'd build Eth 2.0, because Ethereum is about creating a decentralized version of the internet.  Ethereum has a much bigger vision than Bitcoin and if it succeeds should be worth magnitudes more than Bitcoin which focuses only on 21 million with tons of uncertainty about whether it is possible to have a secure network.  I actually wrote on this general topic here: https:--www.evanvanness.com-post-180338466391-bear-markets-are-useful-for-examining-theses

> ETH: Issuance reduction is just a several months away, but the goalpost is shifting again and again.

It's coming imminently.  It didn't happen already only because there was a consensus issue in the upcoming hardfork.

> ETH: Now we are told that POW will run along POS, ""for a foreseeable future"".

It's been part of the transition plans for a long time.  Maybe 12 months now?

> ETH: ProgPOW plans are not discussed on developers meetings anymore. Why? Just because.

Two reasons: 1) ProgPOW was a proposal, but it wasn't a solution that could be taken off the shelf and immediately stuck into production.  Work had to be done.  Which leads to reason 2) it's being evaluated technically.  You can't rush into things just because someone on the internet thinks that things should move faster.

> ETH: ""Issuance cut would reduce number of miners. Risk of 51% attack!"". But developers doing things that good for miners only (high inflation, no ProgPOW) is OK, it's not a 51% attack.

Actually, as a community we've chosen to reduce mining rewards and also move forward with ProgPOW.   At this point, it's hard to believe that you are doing anything other than deliberately concern trolling.

> ETH: Users, getting tired of broken promises, are losing faith in Ethereum and leaving. Market share of Ethereum have dropped from 32% to 9%.

Markets are irrational.  Tech progress is hard.  I don't see any other basechain that is live right now that is making any serious progress at scalability except by compromising massively on decentralization.  And if you compromise on decentralization, then you just have a terribly crappy database.

No idea what thread you're referring to, but yes, things that discuss price generally get removed.  See the forum rules on the right.  This has consistently been the rule from the early days of Ethereum.

How do you measure the majority? We have terrible signalling tools currently, and coin voting only weighs the will of a part of one stakeholder group: investors.

We had five competing proposals. Some of them even tried to increase the block reward to 5ETH; some attempted to cement the status quo at 3ETH, another wanted to reduce it to 1ETH. The decision to cut it to 2ETH was made after carefully listening to _all_ members of the community.

> Issuance reduction requires changing one single line of code, but it's just too risky. Seemingly, more risky than creating from scratch completely new Ethereum 02.

I'm not sure where you are pulling this from. EIP-1234 is suggesting a block reward reduction, and this was implemented, tested, and is live on Ropsten testnet already. Who said it's risky?

> Issuance reduction is just a several months away, but the goalpost is shifting again and again.

It's happening on January 16 as announced two weeks ago. Tune into the core devs call today to learn about the actual block number.

> Wait, a non-related bug found, let's postpone till after Devcon.

That's because we bundle upgrades in hard-forks. So this bug was related to the hard-fork. If you only care about one feature in Ethereum, you must respect that others might care about different features.

> Wait, Santa is coming to town, let's postpone till January.

While you are with your family have holidays, are you expecting core developers and devops teams around the world to spend time monitoring protocol upgrade on Ethereum? This is a very selfish comment because I know you wont ditch your family, and you cannot expect that from others either.

I'm really tired of the type of short-term thinking that is embodied in posts like these.  And I say that as someone who is substantially invested into this platform as a long term investor. And as a long term investor, I feel compelled to speak out against this type of unproductive and misleading rhetoric.

What are you folks more angry about? ETH price declines, or what you perceive as waning Ethereum development progress? While there hasn't been a hard fork in a while, *to say that progress has been stymied by Blockstream-style co-opt'ing is absolutely absurd*. I see zero signs of corporate infiltration in Ethereum development, or of any other kind of subversion. And development (both Core dev and 3rd-party dev) is at fever pitch.

What OP misses here is the difficulty of developing for a complex blockchain platform which already secures billions of dollars worth of assets and economic activity. Rushing upgrades into operation without proper testing is irresponsible. Hastily making dev decisions which could create decades of path dependency is short sighted.

Be patient and focus on the long term as this world-changing technology is created. If you can't be patient, then you should probably move on from ETH and onto the latest flash-in-the-pan project making ""faster"" progress.

83,eab2vz5,"MakerDAO enables so many other projects through the creation of DAI (pegged to USD). (Though I wish the interest is much lower since the generation of a stable DAI creates possibilities for so many other projects)

Just look at dYdX (dYdX has no token offerings). Now we can margin short Eth or we can margin long ETH because their system leverages on the crypto backed stable coin DAI.

In the future for dYdX, eth holders will even be able to buy-sell options (covered calls- covered shorts) creating whole new markets for options trading. This means that you can now hedge ur investments. Because dYdX is a protocol, said protocol can be applied to any tokens. So if tokenised securities -commodities become a thing for blockchain, we can even trade options for said securities, take a margin long short position without even opening an account with any exchanges. No more KYC.

In the future for makerDAO, through multi-collateral DAI, DAI holders can gain interest via DAI saving rate. This is similar to how your USD gains interest in the banks but this interest is actually funded by crypto or tokenised assets backed loans.

For instance, if I am bullish on GOLD (DGX is effectively gold, u can redeem it 1token:1gram in Singapore), I can buy DGX, use DGX to borrow DAI (2.5% interest) which I then use to buy more DGX. This is a margin long position on gold (meaning I believe gold prices will increase more then the 2.5% per annum loan interest I am taking since I am borrowing at a 2.5%).

DAI then goes into the ecosystem where the seller of DGX gets to save their money in a smart contract(like a bank) at a certain saving rate (<2.5%). This interest (<2.5%) is in turn funded by the loan's interest rate (2.5%). This effectively cuts out the middleman, the banks.

The whole system is secure and permissionless.

So what is already done ?

1. Decentralised Exchanges
2. Decentralised crypto backed stable coin  (DAI)
3. Margin long short protocol for any token. For now only eth is created since there isn't much demand-liquidity for other tokens (sETH, lETH)
4. Fully collaterized Gold backed tokens that can be exchanged for real gold in Singapore (DGX). Each DGX token is worth 1 gram of gold. Fully redeemable.

What is on the way and in the works ?

1. Multi collateral crypto backed stable coin  (DAI) (Needed because not everyone wants to go long on ETH). In the future, you can collaterized gold (DGX) to generate DAI. A much better choice in my opinion since gold price doesn't fluctuate as much and if you are bullish on gold you can go margin long on it borrowing DAI using ur DGX to buy more DGX.
2. Stable coin interest (DAI + interest) Holders get back DAI + interest when they choose to lock in their crypto into a smart contract (like a bank). Interest is generated when people repay their debts when they borrow DAI using their collateral. ie if they borrow at 2.4% Interest can be at 2.3%. This creates demand for DAI and effectively creates a crypto bank where u can save in DAI and earn interest. When the borrower returns the loan with interest, part of it can be used to fund the interest for DAI
3. Options (call-puts) for any tokens

ETA for 1. and 2. is first quarter next year while 3. is slated for 2019 but since they have already created a sETH and lETH for margin short-long Ethereum, it may be done pretty soon.

**This seamless application of DAI makes me super excited on Ethereum's future.**

**You can already try out some of the features I described. For example, the borrowing feature of DAI via the makerDAO system and the margin long-short Ethereum tokens (sETH-lETH) on radar relay.**

**All of which is permissionless and decentralised.**

**If you want to buy gold on the blockchain and redeem it, come to Singapore, PM me and I would personally make my mission to help you out with the redeeming process. If you are in Singapore, I will sponsor you the cab and guide you to the gold vault. (The redeeming process was already tried by 2 people, each redeeming 100 grams of gold)**

**If you need money but don't want to sell your ETH bags, go borrow USD on makerDAO.**

**If you think ETH is going down even more? SHORT IT. buy sETH on radar relay. For every 1 dollars it goes down, the sETH token will gain 1 dollar in value. THIS ISNT CFD.** **It is asset backed.**

**Don't take my word for it, go try it.**

This isn't some hypothetical imaginary bullshit I am selling you. Go see it and experience it for yourself. As more features comes up, try it and participate in it.

Compared to any other crypto out there, Ethereum is already almost there.

In a couple of months THE ETH COMMUNITY would have created a whole new banking system (pegged to USD) but without the middle man. A whole new protocol for decentralised exchanges  to buy sell tokens or options with margin in both long and short positions.

All can be done in a decentralised fashion without the need for permission and without the risk of any shutdown.

I can even foresee countries like venuzuela would have its citizens rush to convert their money into DAI just to earn that sweet interest while being pegged to USD. Even I personally would hold some DAI and earn their interest since in Singapore, our govt backed bonds are giving a short term interest of 1.88% per annum but makerDAO may be offering an amount that is higher then that. Also in Singapore there is no capital gains tax.

With ETH, ambitious utility plans can equal unpredictability. There's a chance that a manager overseeing the investment portfolio of a large institution would prefer boring old Bitcoin. They might see, ""We plan on changing as little as possible,"" as a good thing. 

Thus Bitcoin is digital gold, and Ethereum is digital metal-that-scientists-are-still-inventing.

There is no argument of this, the only argument you'll hear from bitcoin maximalists is that these applications are unnecessary in a decentralized consensus network. They are though very very useful, as they not only allow for a currency and medium of exchange, but they allow for a platform on which that exchange can take place freely.

The issue is the economic design, i.e. the inflation-supply curve, the PoS design planned for implementation, those sorts of things. BTC is explicitly designed to serve as money, it is explicitly designed to have a set, capped supply, the supply at any point is able to be exactly determined, and the consensus design requires demonstrable, useful work for reward. Ethereum does not have these things (although I agree that demonstrable, useful risk for reward is a perfectly acceptable substitute), in order for ETH to supersede BTC for Bitcoin's specific proposed use case (and the basic necessary use case of any network which relies on individual transaction) it needs a set and determined economic policy to allow individuals to decide if it meets their needs. IMO it should attempt to replicate that of Bitcoin and establish a set cap, a set inflation rate, a deceleration of that inflation rate, and shouldn't leave the cornerstone of it's value to the future ""to be determined at a later date.""",2018-11-26 16:43:00

In addition, value from real world usage is often overstated in these forums. If industries actually started using smart contracts, the value of an ether would be justified to be a couple dollars maybe. It being so hugely overvalued is just because people are not selling Ethereum.

My paranoid ass just has a few questions about the contracts and your internal processes surrounding changes. The Parity multisig hacks weren't that long ago, but long enough ago that they arent top-of-mind. The Parity change was a fairly innocuous change, and further incorrectly labeled as a UI change, which is one reason it got missed and not correctly audited by internal or external folks. 

What steps are you all taking to ensure safety of the contracts - related libs over time?

What process do you have in place when changes (little or big) are made to contracts or libs?

What happens if there is a flaw in a contract or there needs to be an update to all existing user contracts? What does the update process look like from a user's perspective?

**Keep in mind the following before getting emotional:**

1. Early work for smart contracts was done by Szabo, Gmaxwell, Tier Nolan, Mike Hearn, and many others (not Vitalik.)
2. Vitalik didn't invent the blockchain, either. That was all Satoshi.
3. Bitcoin already had smart contract support built into it before Ethereum. It was just purposefully limited for security reasons. Some projects opted to create meta-consensus layers on top of Bitcoin which supported most of what people are doing with Ethereum today. Again, before Ethereum.
4. Conceptions for a ""turing complete"" blockchain existed well before Ethereum launched (See QixCoin [https:--bitslog.wordpress.com-contributions-to-bitcoin-and-the-cryptocurrency-field-](https:--bitslog.wordpress.com-contributions-to-bitcoin-and-the-cryptocurrency-field-))

So what did Vitalik (and friends) do if they didn't invent any of the core technology and similar work was already being used by other people before Ethereum? Well, they took the design for Bitcoin and bolted a VM to it. That's literally all. It's an obvious leap for anyone working on contracts at the time ((((*wishing to start a new currency*)))) and doesn't constitute an honorary degree in my humble opinion.

By awarding Vitalik this degree the implication here is that he receives credit for the majority of work done by other people such as Szabo, Satoshi, and the countless people in the space prior to Ethereum which is just as egregious of a fraud as Wright was.

If Vitalik had any integrity he would refuse this degree. But he won¨¹t because Ethereum¨¹s main strength has always been its hype. Now back to your friendly neighborhood circle jerk \^\_\^ (((*runs away*)))

The thing is a glorified mixer. Useful, no doubt, and great proof of concept for zero knowledge proofs on ethereum. I actually like it better than a true zchash (not Monero) replacement because it shows the ability to send any token you like potentially. But with this useful feature comes a drawback: balances of addresses will always be shown.

The network, ethereum, is not secured by an anonymous network, which means that there is a point of failure, just not one that is easy to get at, the mining network. Not the case in Monero.

Also I do not believe this is FOSS.

It would be nice to see a PoC for a pseudo monero replacement, which would be a contract with a native currency that is exchanged within the contract anonymously, with ways to view individual transactions with a special key, or ways to view balances with a special key. Of course, there replacements would not include the economic inflationary design of Monero, which to many is just as important as the security of transaction information.

An anonymous contract currency would be very useful though, as supply would not necessarily be reliant on mining and could be reliant on any number of criteria (imagine a CDP like system that is anonymous that you send some arbitrary token to that gets locked for value backing), and also would be very useful for DEXs. There is a lot of room for experimentation here, and I love that.",2018-12-03 13:10:00

What matters is how much a particular anon-token is used. I feel like Monero fans often somewhat disingenuously claim that it's all or nothing, when in reality forcing anonymity is a just way to get transaction volume into the anonymous system to make it more anonymous. What truly matters is volume. If volume can be achieved without mandatory anonymity remains to be seen.

Note that I'm not considering a present limitation in ETH which is ""who pays the gas"". In theory you could probably pay someone else to broadcast your tx and pay the gas depending on the specifics of this contract. Either way this is being resolved in Serenity when the contract can pay gas.

These problems are heavily exacerbated outside of STEM, but are required for some jobs.

And I'll also go down as one of the few Eth Developers that could have prevented [multiple billions of dollars of waste](https:--imgur.com-a-t3b1D).

Such is the crime of thinking different, of understanding something truly unique. I spoke out - history did the rest. All that time spent was a waste. Not only did it not prevent the harm I warned against, it harmed myself more by repeatedly getting harassed, making it impossible to become a part of future development.

Even now, I know, there has been no lesson learned from this incident. For me, I've had to move on. I started with ETH, and wanted to continue with ETH. But in the end nothing mattered. Had I used an anonymous identity instead to 'blow the whistle' perhaps I would have been able to continue, but I do not agree with that policy or thinking. If those that speak out against the group get shoot down and targeted into isolation, then what hope is there to empower change?

I wish everyone the best. But all this pain could have been avoided, had you just listened and spent time understanding the mathematics instead of allowing the fearful to dominate decisions. If you cannot or choose not to understand a problem, then you have no right to dictate the solution - without understanding scope, you cannot comprehend the action necessary to change.

With the current price, a reward decrease completely kills ETH mining for every GPU miner. Hobby miners are completely priced out, so 100% of the ETH will be distributed to profit driven businesses that sell ASAP. This will increase selling pressure, not reduce it - driving the price down further.

With hobby miners gone, interest in ETH drops dramatically, and price goes down as a result.

Most GPU miners look for something else to mine. The amount of reward out there for everything else is a small fraction of what ETH alone is putting out. Because ETH sent 90% of GPU miners looking elsewhere, now everything is overcrowded and nothing is profitable to mine but for the most efficient profit driven miners.

FPGAs will crowd out whatevers left.

This means interest in ALL CRYPTO declines amongst individuals. You know - the people who drove this bubble up to begin with. Small time mining is done. Its dead. We were the last holdouts of sm small buyers and interested crypto fans.

Everyone else has already left the building but us and devs. There are no worthwhile dapps. There will be no one left around to use them even if devs built them at this rate. This is going to lead to the altcoin fucking apocalypse and prices are going to keep declining, reducing interest even further across the board. ETH killing hobby mining is killing one of the last things keeping interest in crypto right now. This is pure insanity. 

This is an extinction level event for altcoins, and whether you like it or not, ETH is an altcoin. This is kicking all of crypto when it's down, and if **ANYONE** thinks that reducing inflation matters more to the price than public interest, you are on drugs. Just look at the charts. Ripple and Stellar are still top 10 and their supply issuance is beyond insane - centralized companies control 50%+ of the supply of both of them, something that should be a non-starter if anyone cared about economics right now, and people DO NOT CARE. By fundamentals no one in their right mind would buy XRP, and a crypto with completely ridiculous fundamentals is ahead of ETH right now. Fundamentals DO NOT MATTER right now.

3,ebmafkw,"> What data sources, analyses, calculations, variables, or other factors could be used to determine Ether¨¹s market size, liquidity, trade volume, types of traders, ownership concentration, and-or principal ways in which the Ethereum Network is currently being used by market participants?

There are two types of transactions; on-chain and off-chain. Some functionality provided by exchanges are today entirely managed on-chain.

On-chain transaction trade volume is difficult to estimate. Ether isn't the only currency being traded, there are other tokens (implemented and managed by smart contracts).

Ether ownership concentration is difficult to estimate. One reason is that accounts are pseudonymous. That is, you don't know who owns them. Some accounts can store high amounts of ether, but be controlled by a smart contract.

There are services that summarizes on-chain usage statistcs, e.g. [DappRadar](https:--dappradar.com-).",2018-12-12 15:45:00

The one that really seems decentralized for sure is the IPFS stuff.  But note that what they are doing is creating a Cloudflare gateway to IPFS.  We may not actually want a lot of people to start relying on that.  Because that would mean in order to access the decentralized internet you have to go through a giant centralized internet company.

We probably want our computers or browsers to have their own gateway to IPFS or something.

My viewpoint is that most large technology monopolies have large networks and platforms that they control and decentralized technologies are the only real competition for them.  At some point in order to get away from these monopoly powers we need to create public alternatives, and fully deploying decentralized technologies is the way to do that.

Cloudflare ultimately should be made obsolete by the decentralized internet.  You can see that they are aware of that and are trying to get ahead of the curve.

There is a massive supply of open source participation that is being squandered.

Not to mention hundreds of legitimate open issues, many of which are a trivial fix, some of which have corresponding PRs waiting to be merged for months.

This is an amazing problem to have, but it needs to be addressed very soon.

The project clearly got a lot of people really excited, and there is a huge influx of people wanting to contribute, but we can't just ignore them until someday when we have more time. First, that day will never come. Second, people won't wait around forever.

7,ecty9bi,"There should be a disclaimer that despite these problems it is still the best decentralized programmable blockchain solution. The tools are the easiest to use and it works reliably. These are huge caveats when you compare it to the competition.

There are scaling solutions that work. Building POA networks that audit and bridge assets onto the main network are very good solutions. In fact having parallel copies of Ethereum running  that dump proofs onto the main chain are so good that anyone who makes software isn't really demanding a main chain solution. We have a perfectly fine working solution right now. I'm actually not looking forward to the change to DPOS.  We have a scalability and stability now if you know how to do it. If we need to sacrifice any stability or security for scalability then it is not an upgrade.

I agree the main failing is educational. The Ethereum ecosystem, with Remix, Etherscan, Truffle and the myriad of other tools is a marvel. EOS is the only ecosystem that comes close, but with its programming stuck in convoluted C++ and the lack of tools it's a far distant second.

Yes we need more education and as the CEO of the ReceiptChain project I would also ask for more support for Ethereum based projects that are outside the 'family.' The Ethereum foundation doesn't really talk about the hundreds of other Ethereum based projects that are successfully using the technology. My team and I have built a scalable user-friendly Ethereum app. You'd think that would be something the Ethereum guys would want to point out on a list of projects or something.

I've also been teaching DAPP programing around Los Angeles for all of 2018 and I'll be teaching a class at University of Irvine hopefully next year. I use mostly Ethereum examples, ERC20 tokens and Truffle - Open Zeppelin etc... I'm going to continue educating people because I still believe it is the best in class technology and I have faith in the team. EOS has offered to fund projects based on EOS. It would be nice to get some funding since my project has never had any, but even if we were offered funding I don't think it would be worth it to leave Ethereum.

Double clicking the Parity icon is not enough because Parity will block connections from untrusted applications, so you need to start it from the terminal specifying the *cors* parameter to those applications, is possible after a search across the web on how to do it but is not ideal.

While the Patreon model is an obvious corollary, we think doing this within Ethereum is functionally different (better).

The community decides on projects to support. These contributions are noticed by larger funding bodies (like the EF, ECF, etc.). Then, foundations can 'top off' contributions. 

Vitalik + Glen Weyl wrote about once mechanism for this with their Liberal Radicalism paper. We're excited to let the funding experiments bloom!

We have other operations that can lead to re-entrancy type attacks and which are often dealt with by avoiding certain patterns.

There are also indications, but no proof,  of questionable price movements surrounding the 11th hour discovery of the bug, coupled with recent dubious progpow developments. Hard to tell facts from fiction though. Nevertheless, the postponement of the first Casper implementation also looks somewhat questionable, in retrospect. Wonder who decided that and why? In any case, its all water under the bridge now. The important thing is that some strong hands come together and steer the ship in the right direction the next couple of months and that hybrid Casper or full Casper arrives as soon as possible (It doesn't seem like the market has time to wait for Vlad Zamfir's laudable correct-by-construction approach.

>From my limited understanding of Eth 2.0 specs, I gather that shards will be mostly independent, with cross-shard communication being slow and requiring multiple steps. As a consequence, smart contracts will only be able to interact lively with assets from within their deployed shard, and will have to go through slow cross-shard communication to interact with assets outside.  
>  
>Given this topology, are we not aiming to improve scalability at the cost of sacrificing user experience (slow response of smart contracts in non-obvious ways)?  
>  
>For instance if I want to play cryptokitties, I will need to make sure to interact with the contract that is deployed on the shard where my eth address resides, and not with any of the other contracts that reside on other shards. Then, if I want to interact with the kitties of someone else who resides on a different shard, my experience will be much slower and cumbersome than if that person would reside in my shard (or at least this is how I understand the system will work, please correct me if I am wrong). Given that the end goal is to scale to a very large number of shards, then the likelihood to have to go cross-shard increases exponentially with time, and thus the user experience gets progressively worse and worse.

When it comes to sharding and deciding the separate shards:

* Is there a way to use the starting hex values or ending hex values in a specific order as a shortcut to a specific shard?
* Obviously anyone else could make the same starting-ending values with (almost) countless different possibilities, including any ""bad actors"", but even then the EVM was able to move the beginning of the account without having to read the entire account address.
* This could, hypothetically, reduce transaction time between shards, because your primary shard can read a beginning of an address to send to, communicate to the other shard about the transaction, and send the transaction.

People are still confused and think you will need at least a very big SSD to do that. Some clarifications are needed in this area. As well as minimum specs that should be ok for all ETH 2.0 phases. The nodes set-up now should cover all future phases, or at least 5 years or so. However somebody just said this:[""Validators presently require a full-node. It doesn't have to be your full node, but you risk penalties (not slashing) if that full-node doesn't fulfill its duties.

Just asked this in a group this morning, and would love to know your thoughts... It's slightly beyond my paygrade when it comes to technical chops.

Ethereum - World Computer (Smart contracts). Blocks mined to keep everyone on the same page for what's happening on the computer as a whole.

An implementation of something like
AWS Lambda for running code-contract execution.
Bitcoin blockchain as the clock that everyone is synchronizing with.

Naturally, that means it's 10 minute blocks for updating states etc... Although, it'd provide a really cost effective & secure infra.

- Threat potential
- Anything else that comes to mind

AFAIK the time to be able to get your deposit back has dropped considerably from 4 months down to potentially only 18 hours. But if the deposit is one way then how am I supposed to get my deposit back at all?

If the 32 ETH is burned permanently then that makes a huge difference investment-wise. Likewise, if the how and when I can get it back hasn't been fully fleshed out yet by the time the beacon chain is rolled out (like, I'll get the deposit back maybe probably once two way is implemented) that's still a huge additional risk factor that would make staking more unattractive.

1,eev0r3t,"My question is regarding a rather humanitarian topic, and touches on a lot of aspects.

I believe that many of us support cryptocurrency as a way to protect themselves from a global financial sector that has gotten out of control. I also view it as a way of protesting the unchecked printing of currency by these overpowered financial entities, thus devaluing the native-currency (and savings) the average person owns. A transfer of value from the bottom to the top is implied. The current generation suffers from this, and inequality has been on the rise for decades now.

Currency seems to be the medium that pretty much dictates the way a society operates and functions (for instance a state-controlled fiat-currency could be inflated to finance healthcare, pensions, the military, etc. - or - banks can create new currency and stuffing the same pockets over and over again). I don't think anybody here would argue that privatizing the immense power of the 'printing-press' was a catastrophe. Abandoning the gold-standard to get out of the The Great Depressing seems to imply that a BTC-model (a gold-standard) isn't a good idea either.

So who should govern the printing-press? I am a firm believer of the idea that money has, and always will be a, a political instrument.  In a Proof-Of-Stake system, it would be the stakeholders (i.e. the owners) who govern the blockchain, thus controlling the 'printing-press'. What is your philosophy regarding this? And would you prefer 1 person - 1 vote, above the plutocratic nature of Proof-Of-Stake?

Polkadot is solving ""There are all these different chains that have cool properties, but it's hard to secure them all, and they can't talk to each other"".

Bridging Ethereum to Polkadot is basically guaranteed at this point. They are competitors in the same sense that C and Python are competitors because they are both programming languages: technically you can build anything with either, but there are tasks that are naturally a better fit for one or the other, and it turns out they complement each other well.

Healthy Ethereum means that dapps that decide that EVM or eWasm and gas prices for normal operations are too much of a constraint, and would rather have their own chain with their own runtime logic can build a Polkadot parachain, while still being able to interact with existing and future dapps built on Ethereum. Ethereum being connected to Polkadot suddenly means you have the access other way around, as well as secure bridge to other existing stand-alone chains, like Zcash.

2,egmf2w5,"The following is overly nebulous-general and preaching to the wise choir, but as a principle competition is good in the long run.  What works will be discovered, what doesn't will fail.  There is room for multiple ""successful"" solutions, but historically the complicated nature of balancing centralization vs. decentralization often ends up with power law distributions of competing solutions (power law distributions are a hallmark sign of centralization).  This just means that there are a few solutions at the top used by everyone while every other competing solution ends up ""sharply failing to be in the majority"".  Whether solution centralization or solution decentralization is preferred is a matter of what our objective function is in a given ""solution seeking space's"" scope.  Decentralization of solutions is hard in a capitalistic system because of the ""fuck everybody but myself"" modus operandi of the average person.

The key for efficient invention-discovery is for those who fail to relentlessly get back up and keep tinkering.  More important is to adapt and support what works and leave behind what fails---to not get overly attached based on political bullshit.  It may suck to the average person's wishy-washy mindset, but humans have an incredibly difficult time building solutions in an optimal manner working as a group because of difficulty communicating what's really going on (there are reasons for this that won't be quantified for centuries to millennia, so it's semi-pointless to even bother trying to think about why at this time, let alone how to fix-reduce that problem).  That process is what really defines ""work"" in modern times.  This is why every data stream you measure on human group endeavors looks like perpetually drunken chaos.  The ""work"" process of finding the sufficiently optimal solution(s) is chaotic and fraught with risk everywhere since humans are extremely fallible and fuck up all the time because of Murphy's Law.  No matter how smart you or your group is relative to others, Murphy is always a step ahead of you.

Issues like you raise here are just par for the course to anyone who is anti-wishy-washy and understands human nature, but that being said, what you're doing with this post is providing significant value by helping push competing solutions to talk about something useful, economic incentives that ideally transcend any single competing solution to help all the solutions as a whole, regardless of who ends up on top.

33,egmfuv8,"Thanks for the level-headed approach.

As one of the guys that voiced a more critical opinion on Afri on r-ethtrader I would like to clarify that... 

I have no problem whatsoever with Afri (or any other dev) working on several projects at the same time. Most interesting ideas lie at the crossroads of different projects-fields and devs that work in multiple projects will be there to pick them up and bring our attention to them. 

I have no problem with Polkadot or Parity. I like the job they have done with Parity client and find the approach to scaling taken by Polkadot interesting. I wish them success for the benefit of the ecosystem.

I have no problem with anyone raising criticism on Ethereum and bringing attention to its shortcomings, in fact I welcome it and promote such discussions. 

I do not have a problem with other coins. Economy is not a zerosum game. Multiple projects can be successful and their strength contributes positively to the ecosystem.

I do have a problem with Afri attempting to push in a very surreptitious way changes to the Ethereum protocol that had been amply criticized by community and experts. Looking only for their self-interest after they lost their funds.

I do have a problem with Afri promoting a change that will result in a schism of Ethereum during its transition to PoS. PoS being a fundamental part of the Ethereum roadmap since the very early days.

And I do have a problem (albeit smaller) with low effort trolling and FUD. If you think Polkadot is better than Ethereum 2.0, write a medium-reddit post detailing why. Sending a twit saying Polkadot is everything Ethereum 2.0 was set out to be but better, as the technical guy working on Ethereum for Parity... is just low, provides no constructive value and serves to seed FUD.

I don't have a suitable answer for ""what we should do"" to address these issues, but I do know that if we can't openly discuss them and what they might mean, then Ethereum faces a higher likelihood of being captured by corporate (or other) interests at some point down the line- perhaps being rendered compromised or irrelevant as a result.

As a community-driven, open source software development effort, community voices matter.  As we have seen from fervent ""shilling"" rife on crypto Reddit and Twitter in many communities, there is incredible power in economic incentives in driving individuals' behavior.  But sometimes, those voices may be speaking from a place of conflicting economic incentives (a condition which I agree is difficult to ameliorate satisfactorily)- and this does not just include folks from Parity.  Indeed, I suspect (and know for a fact) that many of the influential Ethereum community members invested in the Polkadot ICO.  It's hard to state what affect this might have on the conversation around Polkadot as a possible competitor (or ""partner"") to Ethereum, but I can assure you that it does have at least *some* effect.

I am in no way advocating for a ""Salem Witch Trial,"" but should core developers or those in positions of influence over Ethereum openly disclose their holdings and potential conflicts of interest to a Foundation Compliance Officer as a starting point (for private review, not public disclosure)?  I don't know, but maybe.  This would frankly be in line what leaders in organizations who make financial decisions are often required to do.  I realize some may see this as invasive, but the community is putting trust in these leaders.  Should there be some degree of controlled transparency to ensure that they are not subject to possibly conflicting economic incentives which might hurt that community?  Should someone with conflicting, overwhelming financial interests in a competing project be allowed to hold leadership roles on it?  If they are, might there be other ways to ensure that they are independent or have appropriate oversight?

I don't know the answers to any of these difficult questions.  But I do know that if this network ever comes to be valued in the trillions of dollars, the scrutiny behind these types of situations will only get stronger.  We would do well to get in front of some of this discussion, and think about how Ethereum, the Foundation, and the community could be most ready for such a discussion.",2019-02-17 09:08:00

Thanks for doing this thread.

edit

It's standard practice that, on any academic publication, the authors make a statement of any potential COIs. Including funding sources, grants recieved, speaking fees recieved, consultancy, shares held, committes sat on, etc. If it turns out that someone failed to disclose a relevant COI, this is misconduct and they risk the publication being removed and, in serious cases, losing their career.

In ethereum, this could look like a statement on your website listing these things.

59,egq5yg5,"First off, thanks for doing this.

This whole thing was an ugly mess, I wish it didn't happen but it did. However I do feel there was some legitimate concerns during this event. I have touched on a bit here with this [post](https:--www.reddit.com-r-ethereum-comments-arr7c6-leadership_should_be_held_accountable_to_the-egpzi9s) in response to [mariapaulafn](https:--www.reddit.com-user-mariapaulafn) request for input around integrity (which I have replied in the form). It incited the worst of the community and I don't think many devs response was exactly professional in many cases calling out the ethereum community as a whole as being the problem (this was partially self inflicted on Afri's behalf - not excusing the rubbish hurled at him), rather deciding to focus on the fringe nut cases is not useful discourse (this however is!).

I feel there has been a schism for some time forming between parts of the community and devs particularly since EIP 999 etc and lack of real statement from Parity around it's intentions of recovering those funds regardless of what the community thinks (community has to be on the lookout for hidden changes snuck in) is a sore point and I think is mostly the origin for the question of conflict of interest.

That being many in the community saw it as a bail out for people who were close to core devs, where is the line in the sand drawn? Countless people have lost ETH over the years for countless reasons why does Parity get special treatment? This has festered for some time and it seems the tweet was the catalyst for this to blow up (and some of the more insane theories to surface).

A quick reminder just playing devils advocate here on what I've observed.

I believe that Ethereum contributors deserve the right to work in a non hostile environment, not sure how we can provide that online because internet.

I believe providing some COI statements would help eliminate some ""social attack vectors"". When there is doubt that is where the actual trolls get ammunition from.

Basically how do you see that the community could move on from this very ugly chapter? Is there a need for some sort of professional conduct in regards to social media eg. how does the average community member feel about this? how can I present this in a non-inflammatory way? Discussing ideas is fine but tact is required. How to deal with fallout? This AMA is a good step.

Thanks again, sorry for the long post.

1. Is there a fear that strong leadership by EF will be a threat to the long-term viability of a *decentralized* Ethereum ecosystem?  
2. Is there a fear that strong leadership by EF could *still* have legal implications with respect to Eth's status as a non-security?
3. Is it the goal of the EF to position Ethereum as *the* base chain of 'web3' or does the EF feel that Ethereum will be considered just as successful if it ends up being one of several large web3 blockchains?
4. What is governing how much the EF drives progress in Ethereum?  Not to downplay all the work that has been done, but I probably expected more centrally coordinated, driven, and funded work by the EF up through completion of Serenity.  Maybe another way to ask this is when does the EF plan to spend its last Eth?

Firstly I'd just like to thank the Devs for all you do. Public figures get so much BS in this field that I have a lot of respect for the thick skin required to be in this position. 

Secondly, I would like to echo several posts here by people like DCinvestor who disagree with the behaviour displayed over the past few days. I had made several posts calling people to chill out and take a deep breath over this issue and I know I was not alone. 

Lastly, I want to apologize to Afri and talk about what I believe led to the issues we've been having the past couple days. 

I believe the biggest problem we have is the lack of good faith and respect we have for those deeply involved in Ethereum. The reality is that Afri has been a longstanding member of the community, and for those who actually know him, have full faith that he is not a bad actor acting out of malice.

Those that were so quick to condemn him for sneaking in EIPs to recover the Parity multi-sig, intentionally delaying the HF, working as a 'double-agent' etc. offered 0 benefit of the doubt to a member of the community who has worked hard and who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

Part of this is ascribed to ignorance. If you only see the bad things, are detached and removed from the on the ground reality (which the internet makes very easy) then you are far less likely to have compassion and understand the critical nuance and context of the situation.

If people had brought up concerns about Afri's conflict of interest without immediately ascribing blame and getting the pitch forks out right away that would have gone a long way to diffusing the situation and having a much healthier outcome. Instead, people rushed to presume guilt and malice and that doesn't leave room for a healthy discussion of any possible issues.

We absolutely cannot be so quick to condemn, based on a partial understanding of facts. This is something we cannot tolerate and is a problem in the greater internet culture in general with echo chambers that can leave us feeling emboldened in our positions. 

I hope that in the future, we are able to call a quorum in the community to discuss the issues in a calm manner without resorting to hasty judgments and possibly even worse behaviour.

Thank you to everyone in the Ethereum community that makes it such a reasonable, warm, and kind place. I hope we can learn from this as to how to handle any other similar situations in the future with a little more grace and class.  ",2019-02-19 01:33:00

I believe some people in the community need to chill out and give the Ethereum developers a break. 

We've come a long way, and a lot of stuff has been happening, and the Ethereum developers are just as human as the most of us.

The whole Afri situation, overcooked due to Afri being a bit too controversial with his thoughts and opinions, while having a supposed key role in the project. This worries people because of their personal money that is involved.

Is the community attacking the Ethereum team or its leadership? No. Not really.

This is just the community being confused and concerned and throwing everything they can at those at the top.

#The snowflake internet of today

People might find it funny that I mention this, but an added problem is the artificial over-civilization of internet communities nowadays. I'll try to explain that one. Community members are no longer allowed to swear or voice their anger in the normal human way, but instead they are forced to **disguise** their anger in the form of ""arguments"" and ""discussion"".

What types of dicussion? These friendly but passive-aggressive requests and talking about ""accountability"" and bringing up conspiracy theories and shit like that, basically stuff you can't get banned for.

Because everyone is voicing their anger with kind words, these sentences read as very intelligent criticism regardless of its content, and people start upvoting just because it sounds good.

**Result:** The development team reads this stuff and the upvotes it has received, and they'll **get the feeling** the entire community is against them causing an escalation of the situation to be not too far off ( ea. Afri going offline).


So I'd say: Stop it guys. Stop this nonsense. 

# Accountability

Let's not over-complicate things and let's not get into this trap of over-governance and provable accountability and all of that bs.

Ethereum developers really shouldn't have to devote so much of their time to deal with all of this bullshit.

This is what you get with this whole over-civilization of the internet, and the concern-trolling that forms as a result.


# Democratization

**Please let's not fall into this trap of democratizing the entire code development process.** Sometimes technical decisions have to be made that are hard to understand for the general public, but necessary to progress and to complete the bigger picture.

We should not expect from the developers having to explain every single line of code or coding decisions to the entire internet. Internally is enough. 

**Or more worringly, developers could get concerned that an idea they have could be perceived as controversial by the community leading to self-censorship.**

Developers, and Ethereum, need the freedom of thought which is required in these kind of projects.

We should be able to put our trust on the Ethereum development team to do the right thing. 

# Trust

And the Ethereum development team should be wise enough (**without** enforced artificial boundaries, limits, administration) to not misuse our trust.

**Please**, let's not start nor support a whole governance or administration machine that in the end will only slow down progress, and harm innovation.

I support the Ethereum team fully and I trust in them doing the right thing at all times.

A. What happens if another key player has a COI, has the power to sabotage and chooses to use that power? Not having contingencies in place for that is irresponsible. 

Judging by the tweets I've seen today from Maria Paula today, Afri has been unhappy for some time. That was definitely echoed in the controversial tweets that raised COI questions. The fact that he chose to turn his back instead of answering the community makes me wonder if this has been brewing for a while. 

B. Is there a way of improving communication between the wider community and core devs. (This seems like a great start)

I think that the sort of ethical considerations like issues of conflict of interest are thorny enough in well-defined and established genres of human action and production like science, business or politics - how to best deal with them within a high-stakes decentralized innovative crypto-economic open source IT-infrastructure project is a question that nobody has answered yet. Nobody has come even close. So in my book this follows:

\- Let us not forget what this project is not: it is not a business or an established constitutional representative democracy. Expectations and intuitions about what is acceptable and desirable will vary. Screw-ups are to be expected even with the best intentions.

\- Let us try to stay civil. 

\- Let us try to work this out as we go along. 

In the spirit of the last item, I suggest the following: in the next round of grant calls, EF should allocate some money (and, what costs way more, donate some of the top devs time for in-depth interviews) to hire teams of outside ethicists+IT&complience experts (preferably from academia  and preferably already with an understanding of the crypto scene) to do an audit of the accountability of the key participants of the Ethereum project (this could involve all sorts of people, even sub-reddit cheerleaders :-)) and make recommendations.

1. What is the ""official"" way to get information about Ethereum? All communications channels used till now are hard to track (especially twitter) and-or full of trolls spreading misinformation either on purpose or lack of understanding
2. Should Ethereum have a PR-communication agency so we don't rely on crypto twitter?
3.

(I remember during ETH 2.0 AMA I wanted to shout out to ETH Foundation security lead and couldn't find him...I don't know who the members and their responsibilities are)
4. Regarding ETH Core Dev's and Constantinople, how was ChainSecurity supposed to get in touch with Ethereum? I remember they discovered that earlier. Is it by twitter? If so, to whom? A tweet can be easily ignored. Shouldn't [ethereum.org](https:--ethereum.org) provide the information to report a bug or any other idea?

Quote from his text: "" *I have been running Parity in 36 different configurations over six weeks to gather the numbers.* ""  (<- Is this what somebody who is against ETH will do with his free time?)
6. Reg the nodes prepared for Constantinople fork, remember all the misinformation again? [Here it is](https:--coinrivet.com-latest-under-half-of-ethereum-nodes-are-ready-for-the-constantinople-upgrade-), but also all over reddit, all over crypto media and crypto twitter. Wondering if maybe ETH Fundation should have an official and public way to track it and show the status to everybody? (note: the scrappers on [https:--ethernodes.org-network-1-forkwatch-overview](https:--ethernodes.org-network-1-forkwatch-overview) were gathering data from nodes which were not running ETH mainnet, so they didn't need to upgrade.

**TL;DR: Should we find an official way to communicate to all ETH communities and media?**

A lot of people rely on -u-EvanVanNess Week in Ethereum, as some ""official"" way to find out stuff, but he has limited space there and also we have to ""trust"" him. (no harm intended).",2019-02-19 15:07:00

I'm sorry, but I keep coming back to this and getting frustrated. These just do not jive and I think you actually did a disservice by even making this thread. 

What's the point? 

I'm far from plugged into the community, but I pay attention for the most part and am now running a node from home. I don't really know how you are in particular, nor did I know afri other than what I saw on twitter-reddit. I want Ethereum to succeed as a software project and ecosystem.

This shouldn't be (and I don't think it is) an ""us vs. them-community vs. devs"" debate. Surely anyone that saw what I believe was the offending tweet by afri can recognize how just inappropriate it was for a *release manager*. I'm faintly aware he is a longtime contributor to the ecosystem, but I noticed a definite uptick in participation (or visibility) once I started following him on twitter (obviously) and since I think they became (one of?) the release manager(s?).

I guess I'm not sure what I'm going on, but this thread seems like you just posting to air grievance with some portion of the community. All I see is support here. I think this is a standard case of The Young Turks shouting at Fox News, meanwhile most of us are normal human beings just chilling and watching The Daily Show.

If there were threats of violence, that needs to be addressed swiftly and completely with IP logs given to police, permanent bans, etc etc. If it was stupid comments, they should be removed and downvoted to oblivion. I personally do not know what it feels like to targeted on the internet, and I assume it's scary, but this has totally blown out of proportion by what should be a rational actor(s), you, the visible ethereum developer community and leaders, in my opinion.",2019-02-19 19:45:00

Ethereum has to eventually go through the same to leave the spotlight for new emerging talent and thought leaders.

> And all you have to say is: ""Thx for heads up, will go through it now"". **This is especially worrying because I know you love the ban hammer.**

I do not remember the exact reasons I wrote such a thing. But knowing myself, I must have had some very valid reasons to make that comment at the time. He must have been making a mess the days or weeks before I wrote such a thing.

Now that I've stumbled upon this, it does put things in a different light for me personally.

I must now believe that Afri has been mod power abusing erratically causing him to have fewer people to support him, naturally.

The consequences of his actions and his behavior in the past, must have now come back to haunt him and bite him (*in the form of lack of support*).

This problem could've been addressed and repeated behavior could've been prevented but the Ethereum mod team decided to not address the issue.

This inaction toward mod abuse, has now been paid for with a steep price.

Mod abuse is still one of the biggest problems and it worries me how no ETH subreddit admins (both on -r-Ethereum as -r-EthTrader ) are taking it seriously. Lacking the foresight of how it will cause issues in the long run for the cohesion of the group.

I know they said that it's his fault for not working off the live network, but holy crap, I am a programmer. I've been on a dozen different development teams and the one consistent thing of them all is that no matter how ready you think you are, no matter how well you bug test everything, no matter how seasoned the team is, there are always, without fail, unexpected bugs that pop up that no one considered when we launched the product.

So, shouldn't there be some kind of safety precautions? Shouldn't there be some kind of warnings, preventative measures? Maybe a cap that is determined by the going market value at the time that can be queried?

I just feel like this is a recipe for disaster and as a developer myself, not knowing enough about how these things works, kills any motivation I have to develop myself. This is a ticking time bomb, imo. Seems too risky.

For example, you park your dollars in a savings account to get interest, or in stocks to get dividends and capital gains. An average percentage yield currently for these types of investments is 2-10% per year. The fact that people have decided to park $300M of eth in dapps, instead of in traditional investments, means that they consider those dapps to be providing an equivalent actual value of between $6M and $30M of value annually. 

That's pretty tiny compared to Ethereum's current market cap, or even compared to the annual ""value"" of Ethereum as calculated using the 2-10% figure above. As expected, it indicates the ecosystem is still in its very early days of figuring out how to create value, and that most of Eth's price is still speculative.

This is a good idea but as stated before, without encryption, there is no point using this service. Too much trust on you. The implementation issue I see, is that I cannot generate a *proper* public encryption key from just an ethereum address (because of the hash an also because you should use the same key for different purposes, here encryption and signature).

Edit: Thinking about it there is geeky-but-not-cryptographer way to do it by generating another key from the privKey. The problem is that it might be tricky from a security point of view and you will run in problem if someone uses a hardware wallet. A simpler approach is to exchange encryptions keys in some setup messages. You generate a encryption key and sign it with the priv key then I can check and use it to send you messages. This add the issue of storing the encryption priv key.

In the future you'll see a lot of startups take advantage of these features, and what's cool about it is it appears to be easier to use than Intel enclaves. For one thing, there no messing around with the mess of different bios + mother boards and hoping that yours will be the one that implements TPM functionally correctly. Samsung have full control over their platforms, so any APIs provided will actually work.

I agree with Eric 100% on this. The default mode for the Ethereum Foundation should be transparency, where it does not create an undue burden to do so; and frankly, the current level of opacity isn't a good look for an organization helping to create a transparent and decentralized world.

These are basic data which are needed to have any meaningful discussion around staffing and funding shortfalls, etc. The goal of releasing these data is not so the community can play watchdog over the Foundation, but rather to help it achieve its goals through supplemental efforts where they may be needed.

In short, it's time for the Foundation to think bigger- not just through the research and the grants they execute directly, but in how they can help inform and mobilize the broader community to create and protect the future of Ethereum as a shared commons.",2019-04-10 22:44:00

It's very, very easy to imagine that the critique of not being transparent is of your \_philosophy\_ - eg.  that not being transparent means you are secretive in your nature as an organization.

The simple reality is that transparency \_is not a passive state\_ like the word suggests.  A transparent window into an organization is through an active communication effort, not through the absence of secrecy.  

The request here makes it abundantly clear that - assuming the EF is not secretive in nature (it appears not to be to me) that transparency is relatively easily achieved.

For those that don't know me, I've been a huge fan and advocate of Ethereum since the very beginning. I initially worked on a project called [EtherEx](https:--github.com-etherex) which was an attempt at the first DEx on Ethereum. Since then I've been studying and learning as much about Ethereum as I can. Earlier this year, with Anthony Sassano, we launched [EthHub](https:--ethhub.io-) which is a free and open source information site for Ethereum (along with a podcast called Into the Ether and a newsletter called EthHub Weekly Newsletter).

I'm here to do anything I can to help inform people and spread the word about Ethereum. I'm a big fan of the economics and monetary side and think Ether is on the path to becoming the programmable money of the internet in the future. Ethereum has the best community of anything I've been apart of and as a Mod I hope to make sure that continues to flourish!",2019-04-13 09:31:00

After the chain launched, anyone with a modern graphics card could also mine Ether and put some away.

Your entire paragraph contradicts the first sentence.

Ethereum had a launch that favors the wealthy (insiders, especially) over everyone else.  Last I checked, plutocracy was anything *but* fair.

23,el4izae,"I support this message :)

&#x200B;

Also, it should be said that there are a lot of VCs who have done great things for the tech industry and the world at large. There are also VCs who've turned beautiful projects into hollowed shells of despair. Often this happens at the later stages of financing, to prepare for acquisition or a public sale. Then the founders leave and the world is hopefully a tad bit better. Anyways, just to say that not all VCs are evil and often early stage investment is essential. That's why they're called ""angel"" investors, because anyone else would be a fool to bet on early founders with early projects. 

&#x200B;

Today though, things have changed. In the context of cryptoeconomic communities-platforms, it makes no sense to have VCs invested in a different round than ""common folk."" Cryptoeconomic networks are all about community, and if the platform is legit there's no need special rounds for special investors. \*Everyone\* wants to get in on a rocket ship. Also, if special interests are favored before the crowd, this reduces the incentives to participate, reducing the value of the network, reducing incentives for investors, reducing the incentive to participate, etc...

&#x200B;

Also, the code of these networks can be forked and copied into any other platform. What makes a platform special and unique is the community build around it. Ethereum has something that almost no other platform has, a community. It's the most valuable asset, and every other projects wants a piece of it. It's essential to realize this, to appreciate the value the community provides, and to nurture and cultivate it.",2019-04-18 03:13:00

I have no stake in any smart contract platform other than Ethereum at the moment, but I'm also not so convinced that the technocracy that has been born of our informal governance system is *that* much better than the alternative. In either scenario, you're still effectively leaving governance primarily in the hands of an elite minority. 

I'm not saying I'm certain a better solution exists than what Ethereum has, I'm just saying I'm glad the other platforms are attempting varying forms of governance. On-chain governance doesn't (necessarily) have to be plutocratic either. Quadratic voting and representative systems and entirely new constructs like Futarchy can also potentially alleviate some of its faults. I just think it's just way to early to assume Ethereum's governance is superior.

I would love to see some way of engaging in smart contracts that allows only contract participants to engage in consensus of a particular contract, that doesn't require miners to replay every operation to validate transactions, where the only people that need to know a contract even exists are the participants. Such a system would require a vastly different architecture than we have now, and I believe that Mimblewimble has the potential to underpin such a system.

>The testnet is not optimized for a very large amount of validators to join. That is, we do not yet have a super-optimal LMD GHOST fork-choice rule, attestation aggregation, among other features that will make the code robust enough for hundreds of thousands of validators to join.

I asked a question back in March, raising my concerns regarding the [probability of becoming a validator in a post-Serenity world](https:--www.google.com-url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjmoJr9v4riAhUZTRUIHT3_AcwQFjAAegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fethereum%2Fcomments%2Faw5bkg%2Fthe_probability_of_becoming_a_validator_in_a%2F&usg=AOvVaw0Lq867hnnvp0QBWmsPkqYX). Essentially, I argued the largest stakeholders would have an extremely unfair advantage of being selected (against the average user) in the case where the number of validator slots was limited. Danny Ryan, or -u-djrtwo, had informed us that the new system would be able to accommodate an arbitrary number of validators. Specifically, he said there's ""no cap to # of validators other than the total eth in supply divided by eth-to-stake (32)""; beyond ""a minimum threshold, the committee size is \`num\_validators\` - \`shard\_count\`"".

What assurances do we have as we approach the final release candidate that the code will be ""robust enough"" to meet the elastic demand for validator slots? I worry my concerns may still be valid if there's a short-to-medium-term technical bottleneck in the implementation and-or network dynamics of the Serenity clients.

Such a thing cannot exist because there is no financial model under which it would work.

Uber subsidizes every ride taken with capital investments with two goals in mind:

1. Short term: market share, crush traditional taxis, crush other startups by attrition
2. Long term: removal of human labor through autonomy; this is how they actually turn a profit

2. A lot of the underlying required decentralized systems are not developed yet, even though they are theoretically possible - a non-exhaustive list:
   1. Decentralized ID and reputation system, to discourage fraud and abuse.
   2. A dispute resolution system - driver or passenger did not get what they expected and want it resolved by a third party.
   3. An effective decentralized auction-driver-passenger matching system. This has to predict both local and global spikes-slumps in demand, from both sides of the market (driver + passenger) and quickly match a driver with a passenger at a satisfactory price point, which also needs to be geographically close to each other.

2,emux9kz,"Uber employee here. 

There are other decentralized marketplaces that would work for this, but Uber, as it exists today, has to be centralized. You need Uber to manage identity and security of its drivers, insurance policies for its drivers, in New York now you need to have minimum driver wages so free markets are not allowed, etc. What most people mean by 'decentralized' is actually just a worse form of organization where the top line doesn't take as much of a % from drivers. In reality, just like protocol developers take premines, people who add value to this system with things like matching models, surge calculators, software development, etc would require payment. 

Airbnb I've actually thought of as something that would work really well in a market like this. The object you are putting up for sale - rent doesn't vary in value the way a driver does depending on their location - time of day. There are ways to get around safety issues with padlocks, meaning no owner has control of you like they do in cars. Bottom line is IMO Uber is too complex to disrupt with a simple marketplace.

Because Airbnb adds very little value as a firm beyond simply being a marketplace, it would be relatively easy to disrupt. See https:--www.originprotocol.com, these guys are focusing on Airbnb listings to disrupt and not Uber rides for a reason.",2019-05-09 03:50:00

55,epw0h5a,"I've been working on this problem for a while. My team at OpenRelay has a fork of Geth that enables streaming replication from one master node that connects to the network, downloads and verifies blocks, and as it writes the block and state data out to disk, it also sends those writes to a Kafka cluster. From there, our replica servers pull all of the writes from Kafka and track them locally, enabling them to serve RPC requests without the overhead of peering and block validation. This would enable teams like yours to scale out replicas to verify the data, without having to scale out the overhead of running a peer. Additionally, if you lose your master, a replica has what it needs to replace the master almost immediately, which can be much faster than restoring from a day old backup and having to catch up with the network. 

Now, this solution is definitely geared toward teams running dApps, not individual users. It makes things more operationally manageable at scale, but if you just need to run a few RPC requests every once in a while it's definitely overkill.

We have on our road map to try and figure out how to make our replica servers act as light client peers. If we can do that it would potentially go a long way to helping solve the problem of insufficient LES servers available.

BTC and LTC was easy because they're like so similar and there are so many instructions online.  DASH was stupid Fisher Price simple because the devs made it that way (it's the one thing going for DASH, the killer active and interested team that keeps moving forward day in and day out), and for XMR-Monero, it was harder but I learned it since I had a passion for Monero and wanted it support no matter what.

""By early 2017, Kik had spent most of its venture capital money and had remaining cash of about $26 million, expending about $3 million a month to support its operations. In early 2017, Kik¨¹s executives repeatedly warned the company¨¹s directors about Kik¨¹s financial ¨¹runway¨¹ ¨¹ the time by which Kik would run out of money to fund operations under then-current spending levels ¨¹ and Kik predicted it would run out of cash sometime during the late fall of that year."" p10.

[...]

""By early 2017, Kik¨¹s senior management had concluded that an ICO was Kik¨¹s only option. One member of Kik¨¹s board of directors, soon after discussions began, described the plan as a ¨¹hail Mary pass.¨¹ p11

""68. While touting the prior successes of Kik Messenger and outlining its future plans for Kin, Kik did not publicly disclose its financial statements, including the fact that its costs far exceeded revenues, or that the company anticipated running out of money absent a successful ICO, or other details about Kik and the offering that Kik would have been required to include in a registration statement filed with the SEC for the offering."" p17

[...]

""99. By committing to the deadlines that led to the September 2017 public sale, Kik prioritized its business need to raise capital over its obligation to comply with the United States securities law requirement that an offering or sale of securities be registered unless it qualifies for an exemption."" p.26

This one is funny:

""Similarly, in June 2017, a Kik employee admitted to another by email when discussing the lack of guidance they had received about the ¨¹crypto stickers¨¹:
Basically it doesn¨¹t really matter. The whole point is to make our legal department happy, not the users (who are actually investors and probably could care less that they got a sticker pack for their $10K investment into KIN). "" p.27

[...]

 Despite statements about the eventual transfer of Kin Ecosystem responsibilities to the Foundation, Kik provided no concrete timetable for this transfer. In addition, Kik assured prospective Kin investors that Kik would dominate and control the Foundation until an undefined point in the future. For example, at a conference in China, Kik¨¹s CEO assured the audience that the Foundation would not be independent of Kik:
Now, we [Kik] are going to have a lot of influence over that Kin foundation, at least initially, right? We¨¹re not going to sit there and be like, ¨¹oh, no, no, it¨¹s totally independent.¨¹ . . . Like, honestly, we¨¹re going to have influence there. p.39",2019-06-05 01:21:00

If anyone is interested, we designed these to be not only a fun art design, but an actual wallet.  We did not generate any keys, for utmost privacy.  Customers can generate their own keys and affix them to the back with the provided holograms.  These are limited to 100, each one is numbered.  More information [can be found here](https:--lynxartcollection.com-collections-crypto-wallets)
  
Side note:  We happily accept ETH as a form of payment, too.
  
**Edit**:  Complete sell out in just 24 hours.  Wow.  Thanks everyone, I'm humbled.
  
Unfortunately we do not do re-releases.  Our products are limited and never return.

Interest spreads are collected by the other 99 or so stakeholders in the not-for-profit Libra Association to support the network. Calibra, like Coinbase with bitcoin, will not make up the Libra blockchain whatsoever.

From the [white paper](https:--libra.org-en-US-white-paper-): 

>The Libra Association is an independent, not-for-profit membership organization headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland...The association's membership is formed from the network of validator nodes that operate the Libra Blockchain.  
>  
>Facebook created Calibra, a regulated subsidiary, to ensure separation between social and financial data and to build and operate services on its behalf on top of the Libra network.  
>  
>Once the Libra network launches, Facebook, and its affiliates, will have the same commitments, privileges, and financial obligations as any other Founding Member. **As one member among many, Facebook's role in governance of the association will be equal to that of its peers**.  
>  
>Interest on the reserve assets will be used to cover the costs of the system, ensure low transaction fees, pay dividends to investors who provided capital to jumpstart the ecosystem, and support further growth and adoption.  
>  
>An important objective of the Libra Association is to **move toward increasing decentralization over time**...The association's objective will be to start this transition within five years, and in doing so will gradually reduce the reliance on its founding members. In the same spirit, the associate aspires to minimize the reliance on itself as the administrator of the Libra Reserve.

&#x200B;

This is a valid comment and I don't know why you are being downvoted for voicing it out. This will be the same train of thought as many others out there and just needs to be answered. People will not see what the explanation is or the responses to this if they simply downvote such a post (which, let's face it, doesn't benefit anyone).

&#x200B;

This idea really have legs since the having it on the public Ethereum will allow for the much needed transparency towards their customers which leads to more trust and more end users going to any insurance retailer that is backed by MetLife at the wholesale level. The automation of the claim (via smart contracts) when a obituary listing is found makes the whole process more streamlined yielding more efficiencies within the company's day to day function.

&#x200B;

The internal database in your example doesn't provide the trust portion. You can do the automation but given that it's not public and immutable on the parts that matter, the said automation doesn't hold much value in terms of end user sentiment if it is all laid out in detail.

&#x200B;

It also solves the whole issue where the person that died may not have disclosed the detail of his insurance or insurer of if he-she is even insured at all. For the most part, people may die with these information being left unknown. With this being in the public Ethereum, the moment an obituary listing is found, a claim is made, the beneficiaries simply gets what the deceased is insured for, i.e., no need for them to track if the person that died has insurance, contact the insurer to notify them of the person's death, make a claim... it's just too long of a process. If living people ends up seeing this trend and the money doesn't go anywhere, why on earth they would bother with life insurance to begin with? Ultimately, this gives life insurance another selling point.

""Gas usage is a main concern for smart contract developers and users, since high gas costs may prevent users from wanting to use the smart contract.

For example, if a loop requires too much gas to exit, then it may prevent the contract from functioning correctly entirely.""

I want to know if theres a way to avoid being priced out of the market by larger competitors. Im assuming the largest marginal cost on any transportation network (regardless of mode of transportation) to be depreciation on the mode of transportation. For more expensive modes of transportation, you have to either have a massive initial capital reserve or completely externalize the cost (ride sharing). For scooters, bikes, etc theyre cheap enough to own your own fleet, but I assume you have to hit large enough economies of scale in order to be profitable.

Assuming no differentiation between scooters, you could look at the DAV network as one company competing against other various companies. However, the DAV company has the disadvantage where every purchase it makes has to be segmented into many smaller purchases. I want to know where the cut off is for the average size of smaller order to obtain adequate margins in order to be competitive with a company making all bulk purchases as a single purchase.

The only solutisolution I can think off the top of my head is you need someone to come in and purchase the scooters at a lower marginal cost rate than other competitors but then lease the scooters to the individuals who use the DAV network to rent them out, but I can¨¹t figure out what the incentive structure would be between the individuals and the larger bulk purchaser.",2019-07-01 06:16:00

Or death which could be signed by a federation including selected people which possibly could include official functions like the coroner or a lawyer maybe however that works today. And this could in turn unlock resources to go to heirs.

Oh, and it could be time locked so that if the person in question checks in at least once a year the transfer of the state could be blocked so there can¨¹t be a conspiracy against him as long as he lives.

This becomes extra cool if his estate is tokenized so that the transfer of for instance his half of the house would go straight to the wife and things like that.

And nobody suggest divorce as a status change. Have some respect for OP.

But... that¨¹s also cool because purchases can be registered during the marriage, but they could potentially be split 75-25 or some odd number depending on what the two love birds agree on.

I don't really have a particular question, although I do want thank you sincerely for developing Ethereum. 

I'm almost done with my AI studies, and hope to start developing dApp based systems for getting care to people who need it in their life.

Many things here are one big administrative chaos IRL, which prevents the simplest of things getting done... Although a simple smart contract could help enormously getting stuff to run smoothly. Personally I couldn't see another solution with such simplicity and elegance,  other than smart contracts.

My best wishes for further Research and Development, together with loads of respect.

1,etw37bs,"I was asking this in a separate thread and didn't realize this AMA was happening here.

I'll rephrase the question I had earlier.

I know that 72 million Eth were premined, though I'm unsure of any accounting of how many were sold or exactly how many were split with developers since I assume u-vbuterin also qualified for a developer's share.

Who would even know these numbers?

This next question is theoretical since it's in context of a post Proof of Stake world.

Has anyone done a deep dive on the thought experiment of what happens when one person starts to collect a large share of all newly minted Eth in a world where Ethereum controls 100% of today's total crypto market cap? What happens when he controls 10%? 25%? 51% or more? What if the total crypto market cap is much larger?

What is the number of Eth needed for this to be possible?

Can I assume beyond a reasonable doubt that u-vbuterin doesn't already own this much or is capable of amassing the amount necessary? How could anyone be sure? Is it possible for anyone to own this much?

If it were possible, and someone were able to amass that amount of Eth, am I correct to assume it would be impossible to unseat that person of his power in a proof of stake system after he starts collecting a certain amount of the reward?

Would we even be able to detect if it were happening?

So, a little info:

First, wasn't all me, I'm just the technical lead behind the paper. Editors were Mark K and others.

It's a big deal for me as a self taught programmer without a degree, college drop out, to be published in the IEEE.

It was published last year, but I'd thought I'd share now, because people should try to realize, NFTs can be used for things much larger and important than collectibles.


That's why I built Mintable. So that if you want to experience or track assets, you can, without needing to know all the technical stuff.


This paper is for tracking food products throughout their supply chain using IoT devices, a permissioned eth blockchain, or centralized authority to maintain ownership of private keys.

It's not a decentralized model that can be applied across the globe, but a model built for specific use cases and to serve a specific purpose.


Between HN, Mintable, Bullionix, Proof of Bobble, Decent apparel, and others, we have helped multiple companies and projects get started tokenizing assets within seconds.

Money is a good store of value over time. It is something that remains stable in relation to all the services and items that you purchase. The USD and EUR in that sense are money. The milk I buy in the supermarket two years ago costed .95 Cents. It costs now two years later 1 EUR. There is a very small inflation rate, but it is so small that people don't notice the difference and hence believe in the stability of the currency. This is money. Now you may argue that ETH will one day be very stable in relation to the things that you can purchase in what you call the Ethereum economy. But I believe we are at least 10 years away from that and there is no guarantee that will ever be the case.

In the third use case you give Ethereum is used as an asset that generates an interest. However that is not money. You may also own a container that you rent out to someone and therefore obtain an interest rate. However, the container is not money. Your first and third use case are from the structure identical, but they do no relate to money.

That's completely false. Blockchain cannot handle large volumes of data. And you don't need 5G to use blockchain. The only decent way to decentralize data storage is with torrents. Last time I checked you can use a 3G phone to goto TOR, get a magnet link and then download any torrent you want. Are you just securing raw data via encryption then? What's new? 

Also, why would you want a Chinese telecom to have control of your keys? If their SIM cards have etherum support, that means you're putting those keys on the SIM card. And according to Chinese law, the Chinese telecom would be able to steal those keys if the government commanded. 

""digital identity authentication, enabling users to rely on decentralized identification instead of usernames and passwords""

So what happens when your get your phone stolen or lost? What happens if thieves find a way to swap your SIM card? SIM cards should never be used authentication. Just as a second option for authentication. 

""data ownership, which enables users to share data with their financial services providers, and use within a supply chain, where the phone acts as a node to relay data.""

\>Muh decentralization

&#x200B;

Here's some curious facts you might not know about SIM cards. FIRST of all, SIM cards aren't just blind secret storage devices. They are fully featured computers that you can program. They have their own storage space, cryptographic instructions, rand number generator, a working file system, even an 'OS' that supports multiple isolated apps. SIM card applications can run a basic GUI that shows in the phone. Why is that cool? Cause it turns out every shitty phone in the entire frigging world supports these basic GUI apps.

Ever try write an app that will run on Android and an iPhone? You can do it with C++ but its still not point and click easy. Well, with a SIM card apps could run flawlessly on both by default. In fact, even old-school Nokia phones. Why is that good? Because there are billions of phones out there and a large portion of which aren't even smart phones. Believe it or not, banking the unbanked doesn't work very well when it costs the people the local equivalent of 10 years worth of salary just to buy the device that runs your app. A wallet application written to run on a SIM card = genuinely subversive distribution strategy. SIM cards are  cheap as crap. You've just turned every phone into a wallet for like $1 dollarydoo.

Speaking of cool, let's talk about cool security for a moment. You kids and ur chain-a-me-bobs seem convinced that blockchain systems provide high levels of security. But blockchain networks have only been around for a few years and in that time poor key management has lead to billions in lost funds. Do you know what system happens to have been around much longer than blockchains, represents a far larger market, can (actually) scale horizontally, and offers near every customer multi-tiered authentication by default? It's the mobile industry. Yep, far beyond vaporware ICOs and non-sense problems, wireless data transmission is actually useful today - and its the security around a BASIC symmetric-key, challenge-response protocol implemented inside a tiny SIM chip that makes that possible.

As for the 'identity management' stuff mentioned earlier - I believe most people interpreted that wrong. What's unique about the next generation SIM cards (eSIM) is they are part of a public key infrastructure. That means that contrary to older SIM cards the newer SIM cards contain a special hardware root public key AND cryptographic signatures placed in the chip at the manufacturing stage. This PKI, represents a web-of-relationships in the mobile industry. The gist is, all of the bodies and groups involved in the process 'sign off', producing a basic audit trail. Because the eSIMs root private key is then tamper-proof, the public key portion could be used to build interesting blockchain protocols. Especially when combined with remote provisioning (done as part of mobile subscription management) = potentially have a better way to identify unique actors in a pseudo-anonymous system.

SIM cards are really ideal for blockchain applications in so many ways because even the design of Android and iOS provide minimal access to the card. In Android everything has to go past RILD and even with root you're not going to be able to push ADPUs. Come again? Well, it can be used as a poorman's hardware wallet -- and unlike existing hardware wallets that get broken at Defcon -- these will have a lot more eyes on them. Pretty cool, but first you need to accept there is a range of problems somewhere between the extremes of blockchain systems and centralization where neither is very suitable, and for me -- fortified hardware like eSIM cards looks decent for a lot of problems. So the next time you're trying to decentralize ur snickerz bar start by looking at some tech that actually works. lmfaoo",2019-09-04 00:53:00

I see. Essentially Synthetix is an only-quasi-decentralized trading system, you nominally bankrupted them but their token's trading volume is only about $20,000 daily so there wasn't really 11 billion dollars there for the taking.

You are not in the right here. When you write something like:

67,f0bxny8,"There is a bit to unpack here, but probably the first thing to point out is that Onyx has been in our discord for months now complaining and trying to generate FUD and we let him do it because there was no substance to his story. Eventually after everyone got bored listening to him complain he decided to post this. This is all coming from a script kiddie who has repeatedly stated he is trying to destroy the project as revenge for being prevented from stealing from SNX holders through front running.

After the first incident I told him he could keep attacking the system, we couldn't stop him from doing it anyway, and asking him not to was clearly not going to work. As soon as we paid the bounty we started working on front running protections in the oracle. These protections were designed to be a credible threat to a bot that was definitively using front running to attack the system. They were released and documented [here](https:--sips.synthetix.io-sips-sip-6). Of course we expected him to continue attacking the system after this, so we had to make several upgrades to this mechanism. All of them used a combination of the oracle and existing functionality to allow for a synth to be purged to defeat his bots and reduce the balance to zero. But to think that somehow his stolen funds should not have been at risk is frankly laughable.

Just an aside at this point: his claim that this was a ""victimless crime"" is completely false and he knows it but is attempting to fool people into buying into story that he is the victim. When his front running bot generated risk free profits, those profits came at the expense of all SNX minters by increasing their debt. So allowing him to continue to do this was an existential threat to the system.

We have openly stated many times that we have the ability to upgrade the system, including the ability to redeploy contracts with modified balances. We have never used this ability before nor do we intend to, but it IS a consequence of being able to rapidly iterate on the contracts and our proxy architecture. The mechanisms that were used to defeat these front running bots did not require modifying balances, they were targeted changes to the oracle functionality to change the incentives for someone deploying a front running bot. 

To be clear: If there was no risk of loss of funds then the optimal strategy was to keep attacking, by changing this and putting funds at risk the calculus changed, and clearly it worked because Onyx is here complaining on reddit rather than trying to write a more effective bot. Something it threatened to do for a while but then gave up on.

One final point, Onyx would like to think that he is some diabolical genius, but the sad fact is that his bots were not even close to optimal and we have to thank him for exposing the existing issues with the oracles but doing so in such an ineffective way that we were able to patch them without an even bigger loss. His payment for this was **$40k USD**. So again, you can decide who is the victim in this situation, SNX holders or some random attacker who was paid a generous bug bounty.

One final final point, but there is something kind of bizarre about someone front running transactions in the mempool, and then having that exact same attack vector used against them to prevent their attack then seeing them cry foul play, but here we are.",2019-09-15 15:39:00

41,f0d0yoy,"I've read the thread, this is what I gather:

1. OP isn't a saint, but exposed a terrible vulnerability in a dapp that could have cost billions. He gave it all back for a bounty.

2. Many dapp developers keep vectors of control in their ""decentralized"" applications for their own use and-or abuse.

3. Tue developers of this dapp double crossed him using those vectors they intentionally put in their dapps.

4. Now they're trying to smear him.

Having read the entire thread, I'm inclined to believe OP. Again, I doubt that he is a saint but I'm seeing a big positive for him, the fact that he gave the billions back, followed by substanceless attacks from the devs that contradict previous statements on twitter after he helped them find their vulnerabilities.

You're too late though, dapp devs are putting levers of control in for some reason or other, the reasons don't matter. They're going to do it and nobody will stop using their services because the hype is on. DeFi is another marketing buzzword that people are unfortunately falling for, most of it is not decentralized. Honestly I've become jaded and disheartened by the ethereum ""ecosystem"" and user community, but in hindsight it was always going to go this way. After the bull, the ICO bubble, the handful of dapps that brought value, the hacks and contingencies, the user community has become all about debt, regulation and the hype of the day. I miss the days before the dao and shortly after, when everything was about the possibilities, true decentralized uncontrollable financial applications, and I still love ethereum but I have found myself engaging less and less with the community and less and less interested in every new dapp that goes online.

Let's take a simple example for people who played Diablo 2 back in it's days. There was no real currency ingame for trading and so people defined an ingame item to be the new currency. It was a ring called ""Stone of Jordan"" or short ""soj"". Later everything in the game was traded in its value in amount of rings and the value became stable like a specific pair of gloves were always around 1 soj. Since the trade window could include a maximum of 40 fields, 40 sojs was the absolute max to make a trade with and there could not be anything of more value than 40 sojs.

16,f1b0ijl,"Actually it seems that 10M gas is not a problem for block computation and propagation, uncle rates are quite stable. So the problems to look at carefully are:

* Performance degradation mostly due to the large (and increasing) state size.
* Increased storage requirements mostly due to keeping blocks, event  logs (receipts), and state history (currently prunable in major  clients).

([https:--docs.ethhub.io-ethereum-roadmap-ethereum-1.x-](https:--docs.ethhub.io-ethereum-roadmap-ethereum-1.x-))

I think that the second problem is easily addressable with more ""clever"" full nodes like geth 1.9.x and with more efficient and capable Hard Drives-Interconnection Protocols ( PCIe-4), and it will be in the future even with far more gas block limit.

So, in my opinion, performance degradation due to large state size is the actual prospective problem, and I think that part of the solution is assign a price to have a ""state slot"" over time in the ethereum blockchain. I hope that A.Akunov show us a way at the next Devcon.

Anyway part of the solution is either (and always) a better database handling by the node and geth team is doing a ""Tremendous"" job to kick the can far away.

Wow; nope! Gas is Ether, designated for use as gas for the transaction, _NOT_ a separate currency!

Edit: Woah, this is becoming quite the debate! The relationship between Gas and Ether is fairly complex, and boiling it down to a single sentence can have lots of shades of nuance to it. ""Separate Cryptocurrency"" I'd say is definitely wrong (there's nothing cryptographic about ""gas""), though my summary might not be the most correct either. [this article](https:--media.consensys.net-a-guide-to-gas-12b40d03605d) was just published by Consensys which summarized it:

> ¨¹gas,¨¹ the unit of measurement used to represent the cost of running operations on Ethereum.

> Gas itself does not ¨¹exist.¨¹ In other words, it cannot be owned; one cannot have a ¨¹gas token.¨¹ Rather, the value of each unit of gas is expressed in ETH. For instance, an operation might cost 3 gas, which could be equivalent to 0.00004 ETH.

Increasing the gasLimit improve the transactions-sec. This is because all the tx are sitting in a pool waiting to be collected together by a miner and make a block out of it (and subsequently put in on the blockchain). With a bigger gaslimit the miner can 'scoop' up more transactions in one go and make a block. Is this correct?

&#x200B;

Why can't we just increase the gaslimit to a huge number? The everyday users will see a benefit in more tx-s and miners get a benefit because there are more fees in a block now.

How long will I have to wait before the leaves come out of the ground? I have discovered the answer: the time it will take for herbs to dry.


I have used this method of drying for almost thirty years but it is only in 2015 that we have come up with a method that works for each and every herbs:


Step 1 - Do a thorough search on internet for other sources of plant materials that will dry to the same standard as your plants. For example, look for dry herbs found on the internet. This step is very important and very hard to get right.

Step 2: Take a sheet of paper or pencil and put all the ingredients you want to dry in your herb box.

Step 3:  Get a lare container with an opening that allows you to get the herb-flower to a small section of the container.

Step 4: Place the herb into the box.

Step 5: Turn on the fan

30,f70ly8d,"The IDE is gorgeous, but I really wish that 'starter'-projects would direct people quicker into more scalable solutions and example projects could be related to State Channels or Plasma (side-chain) contracts.

Currently people get the impression that Ethereum consensus can be treated like a secure database that's hosted somewhere else. That's not what you pay for.... you pay for the security of the consensus and freedom to include any transaction you like. That's not relevant for trivial transactions or privacy. For that you have peer-2-peer routing. 

The Ethereum consensus is really more valuable for more secure adjudication and issuance. Distributed consensus is more safe from corruption, but that comes at the cost of overhead where a network of people all need to agree on the same things.

Like the justice system, it should be used for last resort when things threaten to go wrong or for highly valuable decisions which are too valuable to trust to a third party.

Ethereum scales easily.

They do no consensus verification, so their blockchains cannot be trusted.  
  
All they do is act as a middleman to relay new blocks to miners faster. Which could help distribute which miners are verifying and collecting rewards, giving more miners a better chance at adding a block, as miners receiving work quicker due to more nodes equaling less latency. Actually this may not be a valid benefit in practice, due to miners closer to the rewarded miner would still have an advantage over further away miners, I think... but either way, since these nodes do no verification, miners cannot trust them that they new blocks they are relaying are valid and verified anyway. Full nodes can add fictitious new blocks to the blockchain, relay them to miners, and have miners start mining a chain that isn't the real chain?  
  
The only way to verify that a full node is sending valid blocks is to verify with a miner, which defeats the purpose of a full node reducing latency between miners.

8,fbfdoxf,"I'd recommend using Dai as it is very well pegged to the USD, it uses interest rates and other such tools to do it and that is something you ***won't have to deal with*** as a user-holder of Dai.

Also, unlike Tether or USDC, which can be frozen or stopped. Dai is actually decentralized and funds cannot be frozen or confiscated by the MakerDAO Devs.

Also, if you aquire ETH, you can get Dai from the Decentralized Exchanges like Uniswap or Oasis, but for ease of use and best price, an aggregator like Dex.ag works really well.

Lastly to store the Dai, a smart wallet like Gnosis Safe (multisig, daily limit features) along with hardware wallets to store the keys like Ledger Nano S would be ideal. Do not hold Dai on a crypto exchange in large amounts because then it can be confiscated by the centralized crypto exchange (huobi, bitfinex, et. al).

29,fbwbg41,"So the idea is that:

> Proposing eth1-on-eth2 blocks would be voluntary, but verifying them as part of a committee would be mandatory; this is why we still need stateless clients. So even if only 5% of validators sign up as eth1-friendly, and out of those 4% are malicious, then the malicious blocks would not get through; the only bad thing that would happen is that on average a transaction would take 5 slots to get in instead of 1.

So if I understand this correctly we've got a period when we've got stateless clients but not EWASM and the whole new execution environment caboodle. There's a beacon chain that handles its own consensus, and a total of 1 (one) shard consisting of the ETH1 environment. You have to opt in to propose ETH1 blocks (or indeed since that's the only shard, any blocks at all) but you still have to be able to validate the ETH1 chain.

We have the pieces in place for this shortly after the beacon chain launches, with the exception of stateless clients, which if I understand correctly is [extremely not done](https:--www.reddit.com-r-ethereum-comments-e8ujfy-are_stateless_clients_a_dead_end-)???

Why not go the extra step and just require stakers to have the full ETH1 state? That way we don't have to wait around for stateless clients before we stop printing vast amounts of money to destroy the planet?",2019-12-24 07:58:00

I mainly bought them because of the stunning visuals and as cool collectible PoC to support further research in the area and not necessarily because i believe these will be (widely) accepted a medium to transact or exchange goods and services anytime soon but i can envision a future where some form of this tech is indeed ubiquitous.

The Kong (an ERC20 token) is actually stored in a timelocked smart contract and can't be swiped before the claim date printed on each note so there is no risk of a previous owner of the note having tampered with it.

Of course it's a private implementation; nation-states digitizing their fiat will require a lot more than ETH 1.0's throughput. The key thing to understand here is that, should ETH successfully scale to meet those needs, the prior experimentation will mean that the reserve bank is in a much better position to move the tech to a scalable version of Ethereum (like an ETH 2.0 shard).

This raises a lot of interesting questions. The resulting demand would obviously be great for ETH hodlers. On the other hand, I don't think I'm alone in stating that I didn't get into Ethereum so that nation-states could digitize their money. Imagine a scenario where an abhorrent regime is using the tech. Will there be calls to selectively censor those shards or transactions? Will ETH 2.0's consensus mechanism be built in such a way that this type of censorship is effectively impossible - even if the vast majority of the community (and validators) agrees on it?

Questions for way down the road. But for now, it's cool to see all the experimentation. Once Ethereum provides sufficient scalability and privacy, things gon' get cray.",2020-01-10 05:53:00

My question is regarding EIP-1559. The stated intention are to essentially smooth tx fees and improve the UX for users. From this we get the base fee + burn model. This basefee doesn't actually go towards miners-validators though. In my view this will have either of two results, block rewards will be on average higher to compensate the lack of fee, or the tip will increase to the point where it is equal and volatile like we have in transactions today.

In effect, this base fee will end up being an expense on users making transactions instead of offloading that as slightly higher block rewards, and overall it will be more expensive per transaction on ethereum after this change than before.

I am not entirely against higher fees for users for the benefit of a burn model, but that does not appear to be the goal-intent of the EIP. Am I misunderstanding how this works or is this a valid concern?",2020-02-05 22:49:00

0,fgmz9pr,"I believe that it's important to protect Eth1's network effects during the transition to Eth2. These network effects are meaningful and will grow a lot before phase 2 is ready. Disruptions such as ETHv2 being a totally separate-forked currency, dapps needing explicit migration, or in general any hassle much greater than a regular hard fork, seem likely to damage the existing ecosystem of ""money legos"". Such a disruption would create a window of opportunity for competing base layers to attract Eth1 projects instead of those projects undergoing a migration to Eth2.

What do you think?

Given the updated plan for Eth 1.5, what are your latest thoughts on how disruptive the transition from Eth1 to Eth2 might be to dapps and users?

EDIT: Vitalik remarked in this thread on the team's strategy to ensure a smooth transition:

> If stateless clients prove non-viable, there's the backup option of merging eth1 as-is into the beacon chain, though this has a lot more costs (particularly, everyone would have to process the state transition function, which is quite bulky...)

52,fhtnnne,"I described in another thread for someone in case anyone doesnt understand it. I could be wrong on some things though so feel free to correct me:

So from my understand this is how it works, Im just gonna use fake numbers here. 

1) He borrowed $10 from ethereum using the flash loan meaning it was practically a free loan. 

2) He sent $5 to bzx and opened a short position. Im not familiar with bzx either but Im sure it handles shorts like really any other platform. So he opens the position that will make him money if wbtc goes down. (I can go into detail on how this happens but it usually has to do with selling someone elses share with the agreement you will pay back the share in the future.). Bzx allows you to trade on margin so if you put in $5 of btc you can short 5x that on margin. But if the price goes up at all while your position is open you can be liquidated and lose all the btc you had to cover the position. Kind of confusing but its how a lot of loans in defi work. So if you have a $5 short margined 5x then you actually have a $25 short position. The wayhe way this makes sense for both parties is that if the price went up $1 then $1x$5 would mean the entire short position would have to be liquidated. People doing this are counting on the fact that the price will go down. If the price goes down $1 then you can make $5 if you close it right away. Theres other factors at play here like you would be liquidated way before your position loses its coverage. 

3) He sent the other $5 to compound and took out a loan from compound. This is similar as bzx but going the opposite way. So you put in $5 of ethereum and get a $4 loan of bitcoin. If the price of ethereum decreases so that your $5 turns to $4 then your position gets liquidated to cover the loan you took on bitcoin.  

4) He transfers the $4 in bitcoin to uniswap. Not 100% sure on this but I believe Uniswap works by just having pools of currency. If a large amount is transferred to the pool of a certain currency then the price will go down. Its possible to crash any price especially on a small market like uniswap provided you have enough currency. Here 112 btc was certainly enough to lower the price enough for the persons short. Its important to note bzx used only uniswaps price feed to determine what the price is for shorts. 

5) The price of bitcoin dropped so he was easily able to close his leveraged d short position.  So the price of bitcoin went from $4 to $3. His short position was leveraged 5x so he made $4 per bitcoin he has. He lost $1 from the bitcoin he was actually holding going down $1 but gained $5 from the leveraged short position he had. 

6) He then takes the money he made from the short position and buys ethereum to pay back his original flash loan. He keeps whatever his profit is. 

This all works because of a few things. Flash loans which give you the original ethereum at basically no cost. Margin shorting which allows you to multiply how far your dollar is going. Bzx fucking up and only using a small protocol for the price feed.",2020-02-17 02:02:00

5,fhufaft,"Oracle attacks like this are common in finance. This kind of thing has happened countless times to Bitmex BTC derivatives.

One interesting thing is that these kinds of attacks actually make the oracle stronger in the long run. Marketmakers in the that Uniswap market for instance got some nice fees on both the attack and the arbitrage that corrected the price. This will incentive more people to add liquidity to the market and make it stronger. 

The key thing in my mind is that the derivative has to be limited in value compared to the strength of the oracle so that it is not economical to attack it. So a short of that size-leverage should never have been allowed against such an oracle tied to such a thinly traded market. If the attacker can do this kind of math, then then bZx should also be able to do it as well.",2020-02-17 04:42:00

54,fkaat1w,"OPs description is flat out wrong (however the article itself is right) and I would even go so far as to call it a blatant lie.

The act revokes section 230 protection (a ""platform"" is not liable for user generated content posted to it) from firms who do not provide a backdoor for the US government in their end to end encryption. This would mean Facebook for example would have to either put a back door in or get in trouble if a user posts illegal content on their site. The likely outcome is that Facebook disconnects messenger from the Facebook platform, creates a separate legal entity and that way Facebook is not liable for the actions of Messenger. And since Messenger's service, ""Messenger"" is end to end encrypted nobody can ever see if they're liable for anything.

Also bear in mind, this only affects *services*. Platforms. It does not affect p2p *at all*. It wouldn't affect smart contracts that were truly decentralized. It couldn't affect distributed blockchain networks because there is no service provider to revoke section 230 protection from.

The *real* bad news about this bill is that it is vague enough that in the future TLS and SSL can be construed to be ""end to end encryption"" and the government could revoke protection from any website that hosts user generated content that *doesn't use backdoored SSL*, meaning every HTTPS connection to a site hosting user generated content could be middlemanned by the government.

I¨¹m watching for the decentralize projects around our own data. Pretty sure that you check competitors- collaborators before. Two projects that do this so far are (afaik) is Mastodon.org, and diasporafoundation.org- one is more like Twitter, another like Facebook.
